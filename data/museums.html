<h1>HISTORY – COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</h1>
<h2>Archaeology</h2>
<h3>Pre-medieval</h3>
<p>The collections include several Neolithic carved stone balls recovered from across North-east Scotland. There are Neolithic to Bronze Age axes and some Bronze Age weaponry such as swords, daggers and spear heads, much of which was acquired from private collectors. Collected Bronze Age domestic objects include beakers, one highlight being the Scotstown beaker. There is an important collection of flintwork from local excavations, including Mesolithic finds from the Dee valley and later examples dating to the Bronze Age.</p>
<h3>Medieval</h3>
<p>The strength of the collections lies in the substantial body of local medieval material, most of which was excavated in the city from the 1970s onwards. It is composed of pottery, metalwork, glass, wood, bone and leather objects and textiles, and is backed up by a substantial archive. Significant objects include bone dice and gaming pieces, an ice skate made of horse bone dating to the 1300s, and a wooden currach paddle found in the city centre, dating to the 1200s-1300s. There is also a small collection of human remains from local excavations.</p>
<h3>Post Medieval</h3>
<p>Much of the post-medieval archaeology collection is domestic objects (dating from 1600 onwards) found in excavations in the city such as buttons, pipes, glass bottles and pottery. Interesting pieces include a pipe clay wig curler dating to the 1700s found on the site of the Carmelite Friary in Aberdeen, and a bone toothbrush dating to the 1800s found in the city centre.</p>
<h2>Numismatics</h2>
<h3>Currency, coins, and banknotes</h3>
<p>The core of the numismatics collection is the two complete medieval coin hoards, and part of a third (amounting to over 3500 coins). As would be expected for this period, the majority were issued in England. These are supplemented by a much smaller collection of Scottish issued coins from the medieval period and around 350 post-1707 machine struck UK coinage and just under 1000 non-UK coins from various periods. The most significant post-Medieval material are the banknotes and cheques issued by NE Scotland banks.</p>
<h3>Medals</h3>
<p>There are around 750 medals including commemorative, prize and military medals, mostly dating from the 1800s to present day but with some as early as the 1600s. Many are locally relevant. These include exhibition medals, City Burgess and other badges. There are examples of foreign medals, notably those belonging to James Maurice Frost who was born in Aberdeen and rose the to rank of Brigadier-General in the Imperial Ottoman Artillery, with the rank of Pasha during the 1880s.</p>
<h2>Maritime History</h2>
<h3>Aberdeen Harbour</h3>
<p>Many archaeological objects in the collection reflect trade and industry due to the importance of Aberdeen Harbour as a trading port. For the more modern period there are engineering patterns, diving equipment used in harbour maintenance. Around 90% of material relating to the Harbour is photographs (over 500) and paintings (over 1000).</p>
<h3>Energy industries</h3>
<p>The offshore energy industries are a core part of displays at Aberdeen Maritime Museum, where the public can learn about its history, development and future. The 1300+ collection is strong in regards to contemporary offshore oil and gas technical activities, models of ships and oil platforms, and artworks of life and work offshore. The collection contains objects relating to the Piper Alpha Oil and Gas Platform Disaster of 6th July 1988, including maquettes produced as part of the production of the Piper Alpha Memorial.</p>
<h3>Fishing</h3>
<p>As a primary industry of NE Scotland, fishing is well represented with models, photographs, company records and paintings relating to life and work in small fishing communities, trawling, fish processing, fisheries research and the environmental impact of fishing (around 1500 items). The collection is comprehensive in regards the operation of the fishing fleet, including significant material relating to Richard Irvin showing all aspects of fitting a fishing fleet, and includes models of the prototype fishing vessel that performed anti-mine work in WW1.</p>
<h3>Shipbuilding</h3>
<p>Shipbuilding and its associated activities are strongly represented with a diverse range of objects, concentrated mainly on three shipyards &#8211; namely Hall, Hall Russell, Lewis, and a lesser extent Duthie. It contains ships&#8217; plans (over 14000), photographs (over 4000 records), paintings and over 300 models and half-hull models. There are also drawings, workmen&#8217;s tools, specification books, shop floor design notebooks and photographs relating to the shipyards. The development of this collection is supported by a catalogue of 3500 ships&#8217; histories, actively researched by our longstanding volunteers and accessible <a href="https://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/AAGM/collections/aberdeen-built-ships">online</a>.</p>
<h3>Shipping</h3>
<p>Records of locally owned ships using Aberdeen&#8217;s harbour stretch back almost 1000 years. The physical material in the care of AAGM is mainly drawn from the late 1700s to late 1900s and contains around 1600 items. Most items are from the mid-1800s to mid-1900s, and are particularly related to the North of Scotland Orkney &amp; Shetland Steam Navigation Company which provided the lifeline link to Northern Isles, as well as cruises aboard the first purpose built cruise liner St Sunniva 1. Material related to other operators such as Duthie, Thomson, etc whose vessels operated on the global stage carrying goods and people all around the world are also held.</p>
<h3>Whaling</h3>
<p>Whaling was a very short term industry in Aberdeen compared to Dundee or Peterhead, and the collection is correspondingly small (around 130 items), including ship models, harpoons and scrimshaw. The links between whaling, whalers and the exploration of the Arctic and Antarctic are not so well represented, nor is the economic boost whaling gave to local shipbuilding and from investment in the industry by local businesses.</p>
<h2>Industrial history</h2>
<h3>Granite industry</h3>
<p>This important industry, defining the granite city, is preserved in an extensive selection of hand tools, images, catalogues and business records, as well as samples and some small items of cut stone. It is stronger for the monumental industry albeit with few examples of ‘finished&#8217; work or largescale machinery and with limited material directly related to quarrying.</p>
<p><strong>Manufacturing</strong>: <i>The collections record a variety of Aberdeen manufacturers from &#8220;Tinny&#8221; Robertson&#8217;s through to Ogston &amp; Tennant soap manufacturers. The following were major employers historically, and/or have been a focus or interest for previous collections development:</i></p>
<h3>Chemicals and gas</h3>
<p>An extensive collection over 1700 photographs, working notebooks and plans record the history of Aberdeen Gasworks and the Sandilands Chemical works. There are few objects from the works but there is a representative selection of domestic and commercial gas appliances, with associated literature. There is little contemporary material relating to the small-scale production or use of chemicals and gas in Aberdeen such as cleaning product manufacture, or chemicals for offshore use.</p>
<h3>Craft Trades</h3>
<p>This collection for traditional skilled trades is focussed on woodworking, plumbing, and shoemaking with hand tools, examples of work and supporting photographs, oral histories and ephemera (over 700 items).</p>
<h3>Engineering</h3>
<p>Over 4400 engineering drawings, plans, catalogues, images as well as some of the smaller items such as tools represent the civil, mechanical and electrical trades over the past two hundred years. Firms represented include William McKinnon, George Cassie, and JM Henderson.</p>
<h3>Papermaking</h3>
<p>Stoneywood, Aberdeen was the last of the many papermills in the city. This and other Aberdeen mills are strongly represented with photographs and plans of works and machinery, images of workers (and some oral testimonies) to papermaking frames, samples of raw and finished materials, ephemera, to transport tokens and items associated with workers welfare (over 500 items).</p>
<h3>Printing</h3>
<p>Around 150 printing items ranging in date from 1700s to late 1900s. Star items are a 1700s hand press and the last hot-type edition of <i>The Press and Journal</i>.</p>
<h3>Textile industry</h3>
<p>Crombie Grandholm Mills is represented by noteworthy samples of fabrics supplied to the allied forces in the First World War, fabrics that went into the fashion trade in the 1900s and barrows used in the mill. This material is currently on loan. There is a significant collection associated with Richards&#8217; Broadford Works, including oral histories, samples and associated photographs showing the processes.</p>
<h3>Transportation and Storage</h3>
<p>There are around 150 items relating to Gandar Dower and the early development of the Airport at Dyce, and 1800 items, mostly ephemeral and archival, relating to railway travel in the 1800s and early 1900s. There are around 65 objects from Aberdeen Corporation Tramways Department. The collection includes around 145 items relating to the Post Office, centred on the material from the Crown Street Head Office and covering the 1800s and 1900s. It includes ephemera, signage, scales and many of the areas of the public interface with the postal service.</p>
<h3>Retail, accommodation and food services</h3>
<p>There are around 600 items relating to local shops, hotels, restaurants and pubs, predominantly from the late 1800s to about 1980, in addition to a largely complete interior of Davidson &amp; Kay chemists amounting to around 3000 items. It includes ephemera, signage, some fixtures and fittings and moveable display accessories.</p>
<h2>Professional, scientific, and technical</h2>
<h3>Photography</h3>
<p>There is a good balance of professional and amateur equipment but weak pre-1880s and post-1960s items. Highlight of the collection is a major archive of 2300+ George Washington Wilson photographs and ephemera, and the large collection of glass and film negatives, slides and photographs depicting life in work in the city.</p>
<h3>Medicine and Healthcare</h3>
<p>The 10,000+ medical collection reflects medical science and practise in hospital, community and domestic settings. The Kenneth A. Webster Nursing Collection focusses on professionals other than medical doctors and encompasses the whole of NE Scotland. The George Shepherd Pharmaceutical Collection contains the contents of Davidson &amp; Kay, Aberdeen chemists.</p>
<h3>Metrology</h3>

<p>Collecting hobbies such as scrap books, cigarette cards, philately and postcards are represented, alongside a range of dolls, toys and games from the early 1800s to early 2000s.

There are examples of sporting equipment and related ephemera, mostly golfing and fishing, and some objects relating to His Majesty&#8217;s Theatre and the Music Hall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				     	<p>The National Museum of Wales was founded by Royal Charter in 1907. The first collections were those of the Cardiff Municipal Museum (originally founded in 1868) which were transferred to the new National Museum in 1912. The Cardiff Museum held some significant collections, particularly the Menelaus collection of contemporary European art and the Pyke Thompson collection of art and European porcelain. The collection also contained a set of casts of early medieval Welsh stonework and other archaeology, art, social and natural history items.</p>
<p>Since its foundation the Museum has been active and innovative in collecting and in developing its collections as well as creating a portfolio of museum sites across Wales in which to display and make its collections accessible. The original Museum comprised six collecting departments: Antiquities and History; Geology and Mineralogy; Botany; Zoology; Art; Industries. Collecting aimed to be encyclopaedic in its nature during these years with early significant collections acquired through donation, bequest and loan. Some exceptional collections began as loans to the Museum, including the internationally important collection of impressionist art and sculpture lent, and later bequeathed, by sisters Gwendoline and Margaret Davies. Other collections include the John Dillwyn Llewelyn collection of early photographs and the Rippon collection of insects, shells and minerals acquired in 1918. In 1930 the Museum of Antiquities, Caerleon, and its important Roman collections were transferred to the Museum by the Monmouthshire Antiquarian Association.</p>
<p>The 1940s and 50s were an exceptional period of growth with the Museum accepting some major donations and bequests. Significant was the donation in 1946 by the Earl of Plymouth of St Fagans Castle, its gardens and parkland, for the creation of an open-air Museum. The Llyn Cerrig Bach hoard of Iron Age metalwork was recovered and donated during construction of a wartime airfield on Anglesey. Major bequests including Sir William Goscombe John’s collection of paintings, drawings and sculpture and the Melvill-Tomlin collection of molluscs, associated library and papers. In 1958, the Museum also established its archive of oral testimonies, traditions and dialects based at St Fagans.</p>
<p>The 1960s saw the re-erection of several historic buildings at St Fagans, including the farmhouse from Kennixton, Gower. Since then collections have been developed through Museum research projects. Amongst these are the significant Neanderthal fossils from excavations at Pontnewydd Cave and finds from the discovery and excavation of a new Viking Age site on Llanbedrgoch, Anglesey and the Bangor University insect collection. Natural Science collections have developed in areas including marine and off-shore habitat mapping. Research into the Welsh Lower Palaeozoic palaeontology and the hard rocks has also resulted in new items being accessioned into the Museum collections.</p>
<p>In 1984 the Museum was lent the Derek Williams collection of twentieth century art and money from his estate was used to establish a trust for its continued development and enhancement. This has resulted in the acquisition of significant new art works into the Museum and the development and strengthening of the contemporary art collections.</p>
<p>Other key acquisitions have been purchased following their designation as Treasure Trove (since 1996) or Treasure. These include the Civil War coin hoard from Tregwynt, Pembrokeshire and the Burton hoard of Bronze Age metalwork.</p>
<p>In 1999 the Big Pit colliery and its associated collections were transferred into the care of the Museum. This has enabled the existing industrial collections of small coal mining items to be placed back into their original context in displays at the Big Pit.</p>
<p>Collecting for the Museum is increasingly being undertaken by our visitors and members of the public. Some of these come through new discoveries from across Wales, for example, a new species of Jurassic dinosaur Dracoraptor hanigani discovered near Penarth in 2014. A changed remit for St Fagans National History Museum now focuses collecting around new collaborative projects with communities and other third sector organisations. One aim of such projects is to improve the social history collections in specific areas. For example a project with MenCap Cymru is resulting in the recording and acquisition of new items concerning the history of some of the former mental health hospitals across Wales.</p>

				     	<p>Amgueddfa Cymru – National Museum Wales is the national repository of three-dimensional material relating to Wales’s natural and created heritage and culture, and of international material that helps to define Wales’s place in the world. It is the leading museum body in Wales; the collections, numbering in excess of 4 million specimens or groups, and the academic standards and scholarship of the staff have a national and international reputation.</p>
<p>The breadth and quality of many of our collections in the humanities and sciences alike make us unique amongst U.K. national museums. Amgueddfa Cymru – National Museum Wales differs from the other national museums and galleries in the U.K. by the range of our disciplines – wider than any apart perhaps from the Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland – and by the number of different sites operated. Amgueddfa Cymru – National Museum Wales fulfils for Wales the functions of all the London-based National Museums and Galleries, and hold the collections in trust for the people of Wales.</p>
<h2>Art</h2>
<p>The Art collection comprises works of fine and applied art from antiquity to the present. The emphasis on art from Wales is complemented by strong holdings of other British art and certain aspects of European art, with some wider international representation.</p>

				     	<h2>Library Collection</h2>
<p>The library collection was started when the Armagh Observatory was founded in 1789. Presently the reference library comprises approximately three thousand textbooks, five thousand celestial photographs, over one thousand shelf-metres of manuscripts, journals, periodicals and textbooks, plus non-print media such as slides, videos and CDs. This Collection is catalogued and maintained by a Special Collections Librarian.</p>
<h2>The Rare and Antiquarian Scientific Book Collection</h2>
<p>The rare and antiquarian scientific book collection also started at the foundation of the Armagh Observatory and continued to be added to up to 1883. Many of the over 240 volumes were part of the collection of Thomas Robinson, the third director of the Observatory (1823-1882). Most volumes were published in the eighteenth and nineteenth century. The earliest printed works stem from the early printing era, dated 1499.</p>
<h2>Archives</h2>
<p>The archives comprise a wide variety of papers and other items, which relate to the running of Armagh Observatory since its foundation to the present day, and to research conducted nationally and internationally. The pre-1917 archives cover approximately 5 shelf metres, the post-1916 archives approximately 13 shelf metres.</p>
<p>In 1795 the Observatory began systematic meteorological observations, and now has the longest continuous daily climate series from a single site anywhere in the UK and Ireland. They cover an unusual length of time (1795 to the present day). The records benefited from the rural location of the Observatory, which has not affected the recordings, as with many18<sup>th</sup> century urban observatories.</p>
<h2>Photographic Plate Collection</h2>
<p>AOP houses the most extensive collection of astronomical photographic plates in Ireland, many of which are important for the studies of Magellanic Clouds and of southern hemisphere objects.</p>
<h2>Scientific Instrument Collection</h2>
<p>The historic scientific instrument collection at AOP largely contains instruments that were used at Armagh Observatory for scientific research from the foundation in 1789 up to second half of the twentieth century. Many of the instruments were manufactured during the eighteenth and nineteenth century. The present collection contains several hundred instruments and Observatory related objects.</p>
<h2>Planetarium Collection</h2>
<p>In 2015, Armagh Planetarium and Armagh Observatory were merged to create a unified organisational structure, Armagh Observatory and Planetarium. The Planetarium holds a collection of objects, slide sets, meteorites, analogue and digital media and archive material relating to space and space travel, which are currently under review.</p>
<h2>Art and Furnishing Collection</h2>
<p>Armagh Observatory and Planetarium have an extensive collection of antique and valuable furnishings and artwork ranging from oil paintings to photographic portraits. These collections form a functional and aesthetically important part of our heritage.</p>

				     	<p>The Armitt was originally founded as a library in 1912 following a bequest of books and money on the death of Miss Mary Louisa Armitt. In her will, she expressed a wish that a museum should eventually be established. The Armitt incorporates the Ambleside Book Society established in 1828 and the Ambleside Ruskin Library established by Hardwicke Rawnsley in 1882. Other significant cultural figures associated with each of these groups, included John Ruskin, Frederic Yates and Mr and Mrs Heelis (Beatrix Potter).</p>
<p>During the 20th century, various social, local and nationally important objects were collected, including artefacts recovered from the Ambleside Roman Fort, Lake District guidebooks and an important collection of original artworks were also donated.</p>
<p>The Armitt has been based in a number of different locations in Ambleside, starting in a small cottage on Kelsick Road in 1912, moving later to The Orchard on Lake Road, then into rooms above the newly-built public library, and finally into a purpose-built museum thanks to a successful Heritage Lottery Fund bid in 1997.</p>
<p>Since then, The Armitt’s museum, gallery and library have been open to the public and the collections, based on the life and culture of the Lake District, have continued to grow</p>

				     	<p>The Armitt’s collections comprise some 76,000 items including books, photographs, artworks, manuscripts, maps and archaeological and other objects of Lake District significance. Many items have been donated to The Armitt by benefactors with strong local links.</p>
<p>Some of the most important and recognised aspects to the collection are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Items originally belonging to Mary Louisa Armitt and her sisters, Annie and Sophia. These include books, artworks by Sophia, manuscripts, and personal objects.</li>
<li>Guidebooks and artworks covering the discovery of the Lakes donated by Alderman Henry Plummer, including first edition guides and large folios of William Green artworks.

<li>Documents, books, and artefacts related to educational pioneer Charlotte Mason who set up her House of Education in Ambleside in 1891, now the site of the University of Cumbria’s Ambleside campus.</li>
<li>An extensive photographic collection that spans glass plate negatives, magic lantern slides, paper photographs, and photographic equipment. Most of these illustrate aspects of Lakeland life and activities, such as farming, landscapes, village events, studio portraits, and climbing.</li>
<li> Archaeological finds, predominantly those from excavations during the 20th century at Ambleside’s Roman Fort and nearby vicus (settlement), but also prehistoric finds such as hand axes from the Langdale valley.</li>
<li>Kurt Schwitters artworks, mainly from the period when he was living and working in/around Ambleside, and mostly comprising paintings of local scenes.</li>
<li> Items linked to other notable Lake District figures, including letters from and to John Ruskin and WG Collingwood material.</li>

				     	<h2>Department of Antiquities</h2>
<p>The collections of the Department of Antiquities (approximately 400,000 items) cover almost the entire span of human history from the Lower Palaeolithic to the Victorian era. They incorporate the surviving parts of the Museum&#8217;s earliest collections, notably the founding collections of the Tradescants, which were given to the University by Elias Ashmole in 1683. They also include a wide-ranging and comprehensive representation of the early cultures of Europe, Egypt and the Near East, which owes much to the Museum&#8217;s long association with the field of archaeology.</p>
<p>The majority of the Museum&#8217;s founding collections and records from the original Ashmolean Museum, founded in 1683, are cared-for by the Department of Antiquities. The surviving parts of the founder&#8217;s 17th-century collections are documented in A.G. MacGregor (ed.), Tradescant&#8217;s Rarities: Essays on the Foundation of the Ashmolean Museum 1683 (Oxford, 1983). The manuscript catalogues of the early Museum were published by Dr MacGregor in 2000 and 2006.</p>
<p>The European Prehistory collection is one of the finest and most comprehensive in the country, particularly with reference to the antiquities of northern Europe. At its heart is the personal collection of Sir John Evans (1823-1908), one of the great pioneers of prehistoric archaeology. This material was used by him as the basis for his influential studies, Ancient Stone Implements of Great Britain (London, 1897) and Ancient Bronze Implements of Great Britain and Ireland (London, 1881), still regularly consulted by scholars. A small collection illustrates Italian prehistory.</p>
<p>The Early Medieval collections from Britain and Europe are especially significant, and the collection of European Migration Period metalwork is exceptional: [E.T. Leeds and D.B. Harden, The Anglo-Saxon Cemetery at Abingdon, Berks (Oxford, 1936); A.G. MacGregor and E. Bolick, Ashmolean Museum: A Summary Catalogue of the Anglo-Saxon Collections (NonFerrous Metals) (Oxford, 1993); A.G. MacGregor, Ashmolean Museum: A Summary Catalogue of the Continental Archaeological Collections (Roman Iron Age, Migration Period, Early Medieval) (1997); D. Hinton, A Catalogue of the Anglo-Saxon Ornamental Metalwork in the Ashmolean Museum (Oxford, 1974)]. The Alfred Jewel, a masterpiece of late Anglo-Saxon goldsmith&#8217;s work has been described as the only Crown Jewel outside the Tower of London. The Medieval collections, especially pottery, are among the most comprehensive outside the national museums.</p>
<p>The British archaeological collections at the Ashmolean Museum are central to the history of antiquarianism and archaeology in Britain. Their nucleus is also of national significance, and includes material resulting from pioneering work carried out in the Thames Valley under the auspices of the Museum up to the 1960s.</p>
<p>The Aegean Prehistory collection is world famous and contains one of the richest collections of Cycladic Bronze Age material documented by E. S. Sherratt, Catalogue of the Cycladic Antiquities in the Ashmolean Museum, (Oxford, 2000), and the best collection of Minoan (Cretan) antiquities outside Greece. This is largely due to gifts made by Sir Arthur Evans, excavator of the Palace of Minos at Knossos, who virtually refounded the Ashmolean in 1894 as Keeper, and after his retirement in 1908 continued to encourage the collection with outstanding generosity, finally bequeathing a fund specially for its support. Much of the material was published in Evans&#8217; Palace of Minos (1921-1935), supplemented by V.E.G. Kenna, Cretan Seals with a Catalogue of the Minoan Gems in the Ashmolean Museum (Oxford, 1960) and J. Boardman, The Cretan Collection in Oxford (Oxford, 1961). A major strength of the Aegean collections is the relatively high percentage of provenanced material and the presence of the Arthur Evans Archive.</p>
<p>For about a century (c. 1885-1985) the University subscribed to British excavations in Egypt and the Near East, with the result that it has the finest collection in the United Kingdom of antiquities (including inscriptions) from those regions outside the British Museum. These are particularly strong in their representation of objects of everyday use illustrating thousands of years of cultural development. Such material comes from early Mesopotamian sites such as Kish [P.R.S. Moorey, Kish Excavations, 1923-1933 (Oxford, 1978)] Ur, Nimrud [Sir Max Mallowan&#8217;s excavations: Nimrud and its Remains (London, 1966); The Nimrud Ivories [London, 1978)], Nineveh and Deve Hüyük [P.R.S. Moorey, Cemeteries of the First Millennium BC at Deve Hüyük, near Carcemish, salvaged by T.E. Lawrence and C.L. Woolley in 1913 (Oxford, 1980)], in Iraq, from Atchana and Al Mina in Syria and Turkey [Sir Leonard Woolley&#8217;s excavations: Alalakh. An Account of the Excavations at Tell Atchana (Oxford, 1955)], and from sites in Palestine and other parts of the Levant, notably Jericho [Dame Kathleen Kenyon: Excavations at Jericho (London, 1960-1983)]. In addition, there are many &#8220;Luristan&#8221; bronzes [published by P.R.S. Moorey, Catalogue of the Ancient Persian Bronzes in the Ashmolean Museum (Oxford, 1971)], cylinder and stamp seals [published by B. Buchanan and P.R.S. Moorey, Catalogue of the Ancient Near Eastern Seals in the Ashmolean Museum I-III (Oxford, 1966-1988)]. The Cypriot collection contains important tomb-groups.</p>
<p>The Egyptian collections of the Ashmolean are amongst the most extensive in Britain, and they represent every period of Egyptian civilization from prehistory to the 7th century AD. Predynastic Egypt is a notable strength. The Nubian collection is also worthy of note. Much of the Egyptian material was published by Sir Flinders Petrie in reports of the Egypt Exploration Society. The outstanding prehistoric material is published in J.C. Payne&#8217;s Catalogue of the Predynastic Egyptian Collection in the Ashmolean (Oxford, 1993; new edition 2000). The Department also houses extensive collections of papyri, ostraca, wooden labels and writing boards, including the Bodleian Library&#8217;s ostraca collections.</p>
<p>The Museum&#8217;s collection of Classical Greek and Roman sculpture and inscriptions is the earliest in Britain, and was largely formed in the 17th century by Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel (the &#8220;Arundel Marbles&#8221;). It is central to the study of the classical tradition in art and architecture in these islands. The collection of Greek painted pottery is important and substantial (thanks to the efforts of Percy Gardner, Sir Arthur Evans and Sir John Beazley [P. Gardner, Catalogue of the Greek Vases in the Ashmolean Museum (Oxford, 1893) and Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum, Oxford 1-3 (1927-1975)], but there are significant objects of many other kinds: bronzes, terracottas, gems [J. Boardman and M.-L. Vollenweider, Catalogue of the Engraved Gems and Finger Rings 1: Greek and Etruscan (Oxford, 1978)], and fibulae. There are important grave-groups from Thrace and the Crimea [M. Vickers, Scythian and Thracian Antiquities in Oxford [Oxford, 2000)]. The Arundel inscriptions were presented to the University in 1667, and Greek and Roman sculpture from the Arundel collection followed in 1755 [published by R. Chandler, Marmora Oxoniensia (Oxford, 1763)]. The Italic and Etruscan collection, though small, provides a representative overview of the antiquities of Iron Age Italy. The Roman collection is notable for rich type-series of gems, brooches, lamps, pottery [A.C. Brown, Catalogue of Italian Terra Sigillata in the Ashmolean Museum (Oxford, 1968)] and glass, and for its pewter and ironwork. Excavated material comes from local sites such as the villa at Shakenoak [A.C.C. Brodribb, A.R. Hands and D.R. Walker, Excavations at Shakenoak Farm, near Wilcote, Oxfordshire (Oxford, 1971)], the Romano-Celtic shrine at Water Eaton and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The Department also holds important archival and documentary material. Most notable are the Sir John and Sir Arthur Evans Archives (European Prehistory and Aegean archaeology respectively), the Allen air photographs of British archaeological sites, the Kish (Iraq) excavation archives, and archives relevant to local archaeology for a century and a half.</p>
<h2>Department of Western Art</h2>
<p>The Department of Western Art (approximately 370, 000 items) holds collections of paintings, drawings, prints, sculpture, decorative arts, tapestries and musical instruments from the Middle Ages to the present day, incorporating numerous individual collections of high specialist importance.</p>
<p>The wide-ranging collection of European old master drawings and prints, based on the Douce Bequest of 1834 and the purchase by public subscription in 1842 of the near-incomparable collection of drawings by Raphael and Michelangelo made by Sir Thomas Lawrence, is one of the finest assemblages in the world and, among UK museums, second only to the holdings of the British Museum. [Catalogues of the Collection of Drawings in the Ashmolean: K.T. Parker, Vol. I. Netherlandish, German, French and Spanish Schools (Oxford, 1938); K.T. Parker, Vol. II. Italian Schools, 2 vols. (Oxford, 1956); H. Macandrew, Vol. III. Italian Schools: Supplement (Oxford, 1980); D.B. Brown, Vol. IV. 17th &amp; 18th Century English Drawings (Oxford, 1982); C. Bailey, Vol. V. Nineteenth Century German Drawings (Oxford, 1987); J. Whiteley, Vol. VI. French Ornament Drawings of the Sixteenth century (Oxford, 1994); J Whiteley, Vol. VII, French School, (2001)]. Among English drawings, those by J.M.W. Turner, Samuel Palmer, John Ruskin, and the Pre- Raphaelites are of spectacular quality [L. Herrmann, Ruskin and Turner &#8230; in the Ashmolean Museum (London, 1968); R. Hewison, Ruskin and Oxford: the Art of Education (Oxford, 1996)]. A particular strength is the work of Camille Pissarro and his family (based on the Pissarro Family Gift of 1950) [R. Brettell and C. Lloyd, Catalogue of Drawings by Camille Pissarro in the Ashmolean Museum (Oxford,1980)]. Current research is focusing on Old Master drawings from the Italian and the Dutch and Flemish Schools.The paintings comprise one of the principal collections in England outside the National Museums [The Ashmolean Museum: Complete Illustrated Catalogue of Paintings (Oxford, 2004)].They are particularly rich for Renaissance Italy [C. Lloyd, A Catalogue of the Earlier Italian Paintings in the Ashmolean Museum (Oxford, 1977)], European Baroque [C. Whistler, Baroque and Later Paintings in the Ashmolean Museum (London, 2016)], for England in the 18th and 19th centuries, and for 17th- century Holland and Flanders [C. White, Catalogue of the Dutch, Flemish and German Paintings in the Ashmolean Museum, 1999], notably the Daisy Linda Ward collection of still-life paintings [F.G. Meijer, Dutch and Flemish Still-life Pictures bequeathed by Daisy Linda Ward (Oxford/Zwolle, 2003)]. Oxford had a key role in the formation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, which is reflected in some much-loved key works by the protagonists, especially from the Combe Bequest of 1894. The holdings of</p>
<p>English art of the early 20th century are especially representative for the Camden Town School, thanks mainly to the Bevan Gift (1957) and Sands Gift (2001). The collection of Russian art of the late 19th and early 20th centuries is also important [L. Salmina-Haskell, Russian Paintings and Drawings (Oxford, 1990)]. A new catalogue of the French paintings is currently being compiled by Jon Whiteley. The modern paintings and drawings form (especially drawings) an active collecting area. The collection of British 20th-century printmaking in traditional black-and-white modes, particularly wood-engraving, is in some respects more comprehensive even than the collection in the British Museum and has been much enriched in recent years. A small collection of avant-garde prints from German-speaking countries has been assembled in the last decade.</p>
<p>The Museum&#8217;s holdings of other European arts are nationally pre-eminent or internationally important in several specific areas. The European sculpture has been described as the most important collection in Britain outside the V&amp;A [N. Penny, Catalogue of European Sculpture in the Ashmolean Museum, 1540 to the Present Day, 3 vols. (Oxford, 1992); J. Warren, Medieval and Renaissance Sculpture. A Catalogue of the Ashmolean Museum collection, 3 vols, 2014]. C.D.E. Fortnum&#8217;s collections of Italian Renaissance bronzes and maiolica [T. Wilson, Italian Maiolica and Europe (Oxford, 2018)], and of rings, are each of world importance in their fields.</p>
<p>The English domestic silver of the 17th and 18th centuries, based on the Farrer Bequest of 1946, rivals even the great national collection at the V&amp;A [T. Schroder, Catalogue of British and Continental Gold and Silver in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, 2009]. The Marshall Collection is the most comprehensive assemblage of early Worcester porcelain anywhere [R. Sword, The Marshall Collection of Worcester Porcelain in the Ashmolean Museum (Oxford, 2017)]. The Hill Collection is one of the most select collections in existence of European stringed instruments in near-original condition from the 16th to the 18th centuries [J. Milnes (ed.), Musical Instruments in the Ashmolean Museum, 2011]. Other notable specialist holdings include watches from the 16th to the 19th centuries, portrait miniatures, English Delftware [A. Ray, English Delftware Pottery in the Robert Hall Warren Collection in the Ashmolean Museum (London, 1968)], English 17th-century textiles, and English 18th-century glass and pottery. Selective collections of 20th- and 21st-century British studio pottery and silver have been developed since about 2000.</p>
<p>Among nationally important archive material held in the Department are the extensive holdings of correspondence of members of the Pissarro family and papers belonging to two crucial Victorian scholar-collectors of sculpture and the applied arts, C.D.E. Fortnum and J.C. Robinson.</p>
<h2>Department of Eastern Art</h2>
<p>The Department of Eastern Art (approximately 55,000 items including potsherds and longterm loans) holds the University&#8217;s collections of the art and archaeology of the Islamic world, of the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia, the Himalayan region and Southeast Asia, and of China, Japan and Korea. More ethnographic objects from these regions are primarily housed in the Pitt Rivers Museum. The collections are of international importance and in almost all cases the most extensive and important of their kind in this country outside London, surpassed only by those of the British Museum and Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. Since the opening of the Department in 1963 the collections have continued to expand greatly, both through purchases and the generosity of several benefactors.</p>
<p>The Islamic collection is especially important for its ceramics, which span the period from the 8th to the 20th century, and an area stretching from Spain in the west to Afghanistan and Uzbekistan in the east. These mostly come from two gifts, that of Gerald Reitlinger [G. Reitlinger, Eastern Ceramics and other works of Art from the collections of Gerald Reitlinger (Oxford, 1981)] and of Sir Alan Barlow [G. Fehervari, Islamic Pottery: A comprehensive study based on the Barlow Collection (London, 1973); J.W. Allan, Medieval Middle Eastern Pottery (Oxford, 1971)]. The collection is also notable for its seals and talismans [L. Kalus, Catalogue of the Islamic Seals and Talismans in the Ashmolean Museum (Oxford, 1986)], and medieval Egyptian embroideries from the Newberry Collection [Marianne Ellis, Embroideries and Samplers from Islamic Egypt (Oxford, 2001)]. The Department also holds complementary collections of Islamic metalwork; glass, including a splendid early 14th century Egyptian mosque lamp; works on paper and illuminated codices, comprising Qur&#8217;anic material and illustrated literature; textiles, including a small selection of 18th-20th century carpets and saddle bags; and ivory, including a royal Cordovan piece dated 998-999 AD.</p>
<p>The Indian collection comprises representative holdings of the main phases of Indian art from the Indus Valley civilization (c.2500-1800 BC) to the period of British rule. It is particularly rich in Hindu, Buddhist and Jain sculpture in stone, bronze, terracotta and other materials [Naman Ahuja, Art and Archaeology of Ancient India: Earliest Times to the Sixth Century (Oxford, 2018); David Jongeward, Buddhist Art of Gandhara in the Ashmolean Museum (Oxford, 2019)]. Among the more famous examples are the terracotta goddess from Tamluk (c.200 BC), acquired in the 1880s and known as &#8220;the Oxford plaque&#8221;, and the Pala stone image of Vishnu (11th century) given to the Ashmolean by Sir William Hedges in 1686, three years after the foundation. There is also a substantial collection of paintings and decorative arts of the Mughal period (1526-1858). A selection of objects was published in J.C. Harle and A.Topsfield, Indian art in the Ashmolean Museum (Oxford, 1987). Paintings of the Mughal period are published in A. Topsfield, Indian paintings from Oxford collections (Oxford, 1994). The Department also has an important collection of Tibetan and Nepalese art including a number of early (pre-1400) examples [A. Heller, Early Himalayan Art, (2008)], and substantial collections from Central Asia and Southeast Asia. The Newberry Collection of Indian textile fragments found at Fustat in Egypt is the most important of its kind [R. Barnes, Indian block-printed textiles in Egypt: The Newberry Collection in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (Oxford, 1997)].</p>
<p>The Chinese collection represents the art and archaeology of China from the neolithic period to the present day. The early bronzes, jades and ceramics were mostly donated by Sir Herbert Ingram in 1956 and form the nucleus of the Chinese holdings. The ceramic collection is particularly strong, with the greenwares of the 3rd-11th centuries comprising the largest and most important collection of these wares outside China [M. Tregear, Catalogue of Chinese Greenware in the Ashmolean Museum Oxford (Oxford, 1976)]. The holdings of later porcelain are extensive, including a significant collection of 17th century wares mostly bequeathed by Gerald Reitlinger, and these are complemented by collections of later metalwork and decorative arts. The highly important Barlow Collection of Chinese ceramics has also recently been transferred on long-term loan to the Museum. The collection of later Chinese painting is very strong, following a series of major donations from 1995 onwards [S. Vainker, Modern Chinese Paintings: The Reyes Collection in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (Oxford, 1996)]. Now Europe&#8217;s foremost collection of modern Chinese painting, it is displayed in the purposebuilt Chinese Paintings Gallery named after Michael and Khoan Sullivan, whose own distinguished collection of Chinese paintings has recently been bequeathed to the Museum.</p>
<p>The Japanese collection includes the only serious holding of Japanese painting in Britain, other than in the British Museum [J. Katz, Japanese Paintings in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (Oxford, 2003)]. There is a good collection of screens [O. Impey, The art of the Japanese folding screen (Oxford, 1997)], and of Edo period (1600-1868) painting in general; particularly noteworthy are the Nanga paintings [J. Hillier, in Oriental Art, XIII, 3 (1967)] and the Shijo paintings [many of which were published in J. Hillier&#8217;s The Uninhibited Brush (London, 1974)]. The collection of Japanese export porcelain is one of the finest in the world [O. Impey, Japanese export porcelain: Catalogue of the collection of the Ashmolean Museum (Oxford, 2002)], while ceramics for the Japanese market are also well represented, including good examples of Arita, Nabeshima and Hirado porcelain, tea ceremony wares and Kyoto earthenwares. The other collections of Edo applied arts include Buddhist sculpture, sword furniture [unpublished catalogue of the A. H. Church collection of Japanese sword-guards (tsuba) by Albert James Koop is now available online], lacquerware for both export and domestic markets, netsuke [O. Impey, Japanese netsuke in Oxford (Oxford, 1987); J. Seaman, Manju netsuke (Oxford, 2013)] and woodblock prints [O. Impey, Hiroshige&#8217;s Views of Tokyo (Oxford,1993); O. Impey, Hiroshige&#8217;s Views of Mount Fuji (Oxford, 2001); O. Impey and M. Watanabe, Kuniyoshi&#8217;s Heroes of China and Japan (Oxford, 2003); M. Watanabe, Beauties of the Four Seasons (Oxford, 2005), C. Pollard and M. Watanabe Ito, Hiroshige &#8211; Landscape, Cityscape (Oxford, 2014), K. Hanaoka and C. Pollard, Plum Blossom &amp; Green Willow: Japanese Surimono Prints from the Ashmolean Museum (Oxford, 2019)]. The collection of Meiji period (1868-1912) painting and applied art is strong and growing [O. Impey and J. Seaman, Japanese Decorative Arts of the Meiji Period (Oxford, 2005); Oriental Art, XLII, 3 (1996)]. The collection of porcelain sherd material from Arita is better than any outside Arita itself [O. Impey, The Early Porcelain Kilns of Japan (Oxford, 1996)].</p>
<p>About 11,000 objects from the collection were digitised to a high standard between 2007 and 2013 thanks to the support of a private benefactor and have since been shared with the broader public on a dedicated website, Eastern Art Online (www.<a href="http://www.jameelcentre.ashmolean.org/">jameelcentre.ashmolean.org)</a>. This, in addition to our blog <a href="http://blogs.ashmolean.org/easternart">(</a><a href="http://blogs.ashmolean.org/easternart">http://blogs.ashmolean.org/easternart)</a> and the new Ashmolean Museum&#8217;s main website, offer regular access to our collections and range of activities on the world wide web.</p>
<p>The Department also holds important archival and documentary material of various kinds (over 116,000 items), most notably the May Beattie Archive for the study of oriental carpets, and the Creswell photographic archive of Islamic architecture, both of which are also partially digitised.</p>
<h2>Heberden Coin Room</h2>
<p>The Heberden Coin Room contains about 400,000 items, many of which are placed on long term deposit by various colleges in the University. The holdings include Ancient, Medieval and Modern coins of all countries, medals, orders and decorations, tokens, jetons, paper money, and other forms of money (‘paranumismatica&#8217;). The collection is progressively being put online through: https://hcr.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/.</p>
<p>Coins and many other forms of money are mass produced so that publications routinely embrace material from many sources. The Greek collection covers all areas of the Greek world, from Spain to Bactria. It is in process of publication as Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum, vol. 5, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. Already published are: J.G. Milne, Part I, Evans Collection. Italy, 1951, C.M. Kraay, Part I (A), Italy, Etruria-Lucania (Thurium), 1962, id., Part II, Italy, Lucania (Thurium) &#8211; Bruttium, Sicily, Carthage, 1969, D. Nash, Part III, Macedonia, 1976, C.M. Kraay, Part IV, Paeonia-Thessaly, 1981, S. Ireland and R. Ashton, Part IX, Bosporus &#8211; Aeolis, 2007.</p>
<p>The Roman collection is also extensive. All rarities have been included systematically in the standard catalogues, Roman Republican Coinage, 2 volumes, by M.H. Crawford, 1974, and Roman Imperial Coinage, 10 volumes, by various authors, 1923-1996. A start was made with the systematic publication of the whole collection in C.H.V. Sutherland and C.M. Kraay, Catalogue of the Coins of the Roman Empire in the Ashmolean Museum, Part I, Augustus (c. 31BC &#8211; AD14), published in 1975. This project has since been partially superseded by a collaborative international scheme which incorporates the Ashmolean&#8217;s coins into a catalogue of ten major collections, under the title Roman Provincial Coinage, see https://rpc.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/. There is an outstanding collection of late Byzantine coins catalogued as E. Lianta, Late Byzantine Coins. 1204 &#8211; 1453 in the Ashmolean Museum, 2009.</p>
<p>The English coin collection is extensive and of fine quality. Some of the most important parts of it have been published under the auspices of the British Academy&#8217;s Sylloge of Coins of the British Isles (SCBI). The earliest Anglo-Saxon coins were published in C.H.V. Sutherland, Anglo-Saxon Gold Coinage in the Light of the Crondall Hoard, 1948. The so-called sceattas of the 7th and 8th centuries are all published and discussed in D.M. Metcalf, Thrymsas and Sceattas in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (3 volumes, 1993-4). For later coins, see J.D.A. Thompson, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, Anglo-Saxon Pennies, 1967 (=SCBI, vol. 7), and D.M. Metcalf, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, Part II, English Coins, 1066-1279, 1969 (=SCBI, vol. 12). The E.J. Winstanley collection is included in D.M. Metcalf, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, Part III, Coins of Henry VII, 1976 (=SCBI, vol. 23). The rich series of Scottish coins, from the Hird gift, are published jointly with the Glasgow collection in J.D. Bateson and N.J. Mayhew, Scottish Coins in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and the Hunterian Museum, Glasgow, 1987 (=SCBI, vol. 35).</p>
<p>The Ashmolean has an outstanding collection of Crusader coins, of which the catalogue is the standard work on the subject: D.M. Metcalf, Coinage of the Crusades and the Latin East in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (2nd edition, 1995).</p>
<p>The museum&#8217;s Islamic coins, including the former Shamma loan, are being published as the Sylloge of Islamic Coins in the Ashmolean Museum (SICA). The following volumes have been published so far: S. Album and Tony Goodwin, Vol. 1, The Pre-Reform Coinage of the Early Islamic Period, 2002, N.D. Nicol, Vol. 2, Early Post-Reform Coinage, 2009, N.D. Nicol, Vol. 6, The Egyptian Dynasties, 2007, S. Album, Vol. 9, Iran after the Mongol Invasion, 2001, and S. Album, Vol. 10, Arabia and East Africa, 1999. The collection of South Asian and Far Eastern coin collection constitute a major body of evidence for subjects with international academic interest such as Gandharan Art and the History of collecting coins in China and Japan. The Indian coin collection is mainly formed through the Shortt Bequest and includes collections of important collectors of oriental coins such as Sir Aurel Stein, P Thorburn, Alfred Master and H E Stapleton. The Senior Collection of Indo-Scythian and Indo-Parthian coins is by far the most important numismatic evidence for Gandhara and has been published as a type catalogue by Senior (R C Senior, Indo-Scythian Coinage and History, vols. I-IV, 2001). The collections of the coinage of the Bengal Sultanate, the Mughals, and the British East India Company are also noteworthy. The far eastern coin collection has recently been rearranged. It includes significant holdings of Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese coins.</p>
<p>The collection of modern coins and paper money is largely an incidental collection, formed through individual donations rather than as a result of a focussed acquisition strategy. However, it includes numismatic material of great significance to collectors of modern monies, such as coins preserved in high collectible grades, coins issued during wars or episodes of emergency and banknotes of very high denominations. Joe Cribb, the former Keeper of Coins and Medals in the British Museum, has gifted a collection of nearly 2000 modern banknotes to the department.</p>
<p>Many commemorative medals in the Ashmolean&#8217;s large collection are listed in Medallic Illustrations of British History (19 parts, 1904-1911) and in more detail in L. Brown, A Catalogue of British Historical Medals 1760-1960 (2 vols., 1980-1987).</p>
<h2>Cast Gallery</h2>
<p>The Cast Gallery possesses about 1,100 plaster casts of Greek and Roman sculpture, most of which were acquired before 1925. The collection was started in the late 19th-century to serve as a teaching facility for the then new subject of Classical Archaeology in the University. The casts provide a strong and exact three-dimensional representation of Greek and Roman statues and reliefs in marble and bronze, from the beginning of Greek statue-making in the sixth century BC to late Roman material of the sixth century AD.</p>
<p>At first the casts were displayed among original pieces in the main museum. In 1961, the collection was moved to its current purpose-built Cast Gallery. And in 2010, after the renovation of the main museum, the Cast Gallery was also renovated and connected directly to the main museum. The collection was completely re-displayed along thematic lines. At the same time, major casts were included in displays in the main museum, most notably in the central atrium.</p>
<p>Recent acquisitions have been concentrated on increasing the presence of Hellenistic and Roman material. Since 1995, more than 100 new pieces have been added. The collection is fully documented, photographed, and published in Rune Frederiksen and R. R. R. Smith, Cast Gallery of the Ashmolean Museum: Catalogue of Plaster Casts of Greek and Roman Sculpture (2013).</p>
<p>The Cast Gallery has one curator who is also the fulltime Lincoln Professor of Classical Archaeology and Art in the University (R.R.R. Smith) and one half-time Assistant Curator (Milena Melfi).</p>

				     	<p>Axminster Museum was opened in 1982 and was housed in the old courthouse. This museum built up a collection to tell the story of Axminster and the surrounding villages. The Collection was mainly developed by donations from local residents. Run by a dedicated team of volunteers they gained Accreditation for the museum in 1996.</p>
<p>In 2002 a group of local Axminster carpet enthusiasts set up a group to plan for the 250th anniversary of the first Axminster carpet in 2005. The events were a success and it was suggested to them that they set up a museum dedicated to the Axminster Carpet story. In 2006 Axminster Heritage Ltd was formed and in 2012 they were successful in purchasing part of the second phase of the Georgian carpet factory. However, by this time it was clear a museum just of Axminster Carpets was going to be a bit niche and Axminster probably couldn’t maintain 2 museums.</p>
<p>Discussions were held between Axminster Heritage Ltd and Axminster Museum and in 2015 the collection of Axminster Museum was transferred to Axminster Heritage Ltd. The transfer was agreed because the old carpet factory offered a much better space for exhibition development, storeroom development and as the museum would be on the ground floor it could be made fully accessible. Some of the former Trustees of the Axminster Museum became Trustees of Axminster Heritage Ltd, and many of the volunteers transferred over to carry on roles at Axminster Heritage Ltd.</p>
<p>Since 2015 Axminster Heritage Limited has taken on the role for collecting artifacts and archives that tell the story of Axminster and the surrounding areas, but does declare one of its specialist interests is Axminster carpets. Axminster Heritage Ltd was able to gain both a Georgian Loom and a 1937 Crabtree carpet loom to illustrate the two periods of Axminster carpet manufacture in the town, as well as extend the general collections.</p>

				     	<p>The geographical area to which the collections relate is the parish of Axminster and the surrounding parishes of Musbury, Shute, Membury, Kilmington, Dalwood, Stockland, All Saints, Chardstock and Uplyme, including villages of Umborne and Whitford.</p>
<p><strong>Axminster Carpets</strong> – this is a collection of original Axminster carpets, including an original loom. Future priorities are to increase the number of original carpets and become a base for a national collection, setting up a data base for all known Axminster carpets around the world. It features an original painting of Thomas Whitty, the creator of Axminster carpet industry and will include a small collection of hand spinning and weaving looms. Future priorities are to collect and develop a full range of linked equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Decorative Art</strong> – this is a small collection including cider mugs, glass bottles, ceramic receptacles, stone and furniture ,including a grandfather clock made in Axminster by J.Hawkins c 1795.Some of this has been photographed and catalogued.</p>
<p><strong>Costume and Textiles</strong>– this is a small collection, including accessories, from mid-Victorian times to the 1930’s. It includes domestic, agricultural and military items. Of particular note is christening gloves believed to be the first Duke of Marlborough’s. This all needs conservation checks and repacking in 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Numismatics</strong> – this contains military medals, commemorative medals and coins. Of particular interest is the collection of agricultural medals.</p>
<p><strong>Geology</strong> – this mainly relates to the Victorian collection of Dr. Connybear who was born in Axminster.</p>
<p><strong>Archaeology</strong> – this is a small collection ranging from information on Cloakham circles, the Dissolution of Newnham Abbey and Roman finds at Wick .</p>
<p><strong>Photographs</strong> – including prints, plates and negatives of local views, people and activities. It includes local companies such as Shands and Axminster Carpets, as well as the Cattle Market and local social events and sporting events. This has been largely catalogued. Also included is a library of local books from Victorian times.Priority areas are future storage and conservation and the completion of digital copies, some of which have been done.</p>
<p><strong>Archive</strong> – this is a medium collection relating to local families, commercial firms, local organisations, newspapers, broadsheets, programmes, paper souvenirs, and other ephemera. Also included are documents from Axminster Carpets, Shands and Dawkins. These date from c 1700 and future rationalisation will be needed.</p>
<p><strong>Agriculture and Rural life</strong> – this is a medium collection of objects relating to various aspects of rural life including wine and cider jars. There is also a small collection of advertising signs relating to local businesses. Most items are catalogued but some rationalisation is needed owing to the condition of some of the items.</p>
<p><strong>Social History</strong> – this includes ALL the other material that does not fit into the other categories eg the material relating to Thomas Wakely who created the Lancet. There is also a good selection of social history books relating to Axminster. This collection will require rationalisation with some items transferring to the Handling collection.</p>
<p><strong>The Handling collection</strong> – the trust owns a handling collection which consists of some real and some replica artefacts. Some have been donated as handling items and transferred from main collections. This is a priority for development over the next few years, particularly in terms of rationalising the social history collections and transferring them for handling purposes. Items selected will generally either be duplicates of other items or not from the core collection.</p>

				     	<p>The collection has originated from several sources, since the formation of Bawdsey Radar Group in 2002.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are <u>physical artefacts</u>, from the period 1930s to 1970s, which were given to the Group/Trust. The exhibition also contains artefacts which were part of the equipment originally in the Transmitter building (and which were too large to remove in the 1950s) and so date from the 1930s.</li>
<li>There is <u>paper-based material (photos, reports letters etc) and other information which is computer based</u> such as Word documents, photographs and the oral history audio and video records. These relate to the 1930s to 1990s and have been collected since that time. Most of the oral history records were collected in the years 2005 to 2007 in the Heritage Lottery funded ‘Shout and Whisper’ project.</li>
<li>Also recently donated to the Trust are <u>items which were developed from radar</u> or used technology which was developed for radar. These have usually been donated by people who have visited the transmitter block, or previously worked at Bawdsey or have seen the website.</li>
<li>There are some <u>contemporary hands-on simulations and information boards and screens, </u>which were designed and developed as part of the Heritage Lottery Funded project from 2016 to 2017.</li>

				     	<p>The Scope of the Bawdsey Transmitter Block Museum collection is to acquire, conserve, document and make available to the public, items which relate to the discovery, development and use of radar at Bawdsey. The time frame is from 1936, when Bawdsey manor was acquired for radar research, to 1991, when RAF Bawdsey closed, with emphasis on the years from 1936 to 1976.</p>
<p>The scope of the collection includes <strong>‘Core Collection Items’, ‘Exhibition Items’ </strong>and <strong>‘Handling Items’</strong></p>
<p><strong>Core Collection Items</strong> include relevant radar-related artefacts from the above time frame. They include unique or rare, first hand, original photographs and written material, including letters, memoirs and books. They also include oral history sound and video recordings relating to the above time frame by the people who were involved with radar at Bawdsey, but which were often written or recorded more recently. Except in exceptional circumstances, these accessioned items are permanently kept at the museum.</p>
<p><strong>Exhibition Items</strong> are usually more modern and include interactive displays, computer-based illustrations of past and current radars and developments from radar. These are used especially for interpretation and teaching purposes, may change with time and are usually kept at the museum.</p>
<p><strong>Handling Items</strong> include copies of exhibition and core collection items which can be used for hands-on and educational purposes. They are used to inform visitors and the public of the life and work of people who were involved directly or indirectly with radar at Bawdsey. These are usually kept at the museum but can be used as part of external exhibitions and to accompany talks at other venues.</p>

				     	<p>BDMG&#8217;s collections have developed over more than 150 years even before a museum service existed in the district. Early collections belonging to the Mechanics Institute and local amateur enthusiasts were collected from late 18th through 19th centuries. In 1974, when Bradford Metropolitan District Council was established the main museums of Keighley (founded 1899), Ilkley (1892) Cartwright Memorial Hall (1904) and Bolling Hall (1915) and the newly founded Bradford Industrial Museum (1974) were united as a single service. The new metropolitan district was serving a wider community. Each site was allocated as the districts site for a specific collection, Archaeology at Manor House, Ilkley, Art at CMH, Natural Sciences at Cliffe Castle Museum, Keighley, Social History at Bolling Hall, Industrial Collections at BIM.</p>

				     	<h2>Archaeology Collection</h2>
<p>The collection comprises some 38,000 items, the majority of which is excavated pot sherds. The core of the collection, some 5500 items, is of local provenance. This in turn divides into approximate thirds, for Prehistoric, Roman and Medieval/Post medieval material. There is a small collection of Egyptology, acquired during the early years of the last century through subscriptions to the Egypt Exploration Fund. A large part of the Roman collection was derived from the excavation of the Roman Fort, at Ilkley.</p>
<h2>Art Collections</h2>
<h3>Fine Art</h3>
<p>The Fine Art collection comprises of approximately 15,922 items and was begun in 1879 when the first public museum and art gallery opened in Bradford. Oil paintings mainly dating from the mid-nineteenth century onwards form 23% of the whole, and another 27% is watercolours, to date mainly from the 19th and 20th centuries. The largest part of the collection is made up of prints, 50% of the total, and half of these date from 1868 or later. There are fewer than 100 items of sculpture.</p>
<p>In the 1980s the service began actively collecting the work of South Asian and Black artists to better reflect the contemporary population of Bradford. Examples include textiles, paintings, calligraphy, prints and decorative objects.</p>
<h3>Decorative Art Collection</h3>
<p>This collection comprises some 5000 items, shared almost equally between furniture and ceramics. The ceramic collection is the kind found in many larger provincial museums. Of note within this collection are the North Country English Furniture, mainly of 17th century oak, Stained Glass and South Asian material including crafts, calligraphy from the Muslim world, gold and silver, garments and textiles.</p>
<p>The World Cultures Collection includes a modest but significant collection of material representing cultures of the South Pacific, Australasia, Africa, North America, Japan and China.</p>
<h2>Industrial Collections</h2>
<p>This collection began in 1966 and now contains over 36,000 individual and groups of items. The main sections include textiles, engineering, public and domestic transport, the history of science, motive power, printing, communications, crafts and professions, as well as technical information. All have a strong bias towards material from, or are closely associated with the present Bradford Metropolitan District and its environs.</p>
<p>The textile collection, relating to the production of worsted textiles in the district, is a Designated collection. This means it has been accreditated as a collection of National and International significance by ACE and that it is the most significant and comprehensive collection of material relating to the worsted industry.</p>
<h2>Natural Science Collections</h2>
<p>The Natural Sciences comprise three separate collections; zoology, geology and botany.</p>
<h3>Zoology Collection</h3>
<p>There are approximately 90,000 zoology specimens of which over 70% are invertebrate zoology including entomology and conchology. Approximately 8% are vertebrate specimens comprising study skins and taxidermy mounts.</p>
<h3>Geology Collection</h3>
<p>There are approximately 80,000 geological specimens. This collection is the subject of a paper in Naturalist: 104 pp 17-23 (1979), which details the scope of the collection in some detail.</p>
<h3>Botany Collection</h3>
<p>The museum&#8217;s botany collections comprise the nationally and internationally important F.A. Lees collection and W.A. Sledge collection of flowering plants and other important lichen and bryophyte collections totalling approximately 60,000 specimens. These important reference collections are based on those made by local naturalists, and have a strong local emphasis.</p>
<h2>Social History Collections</h2>
<p>The vast majority of material is local social history, including local agricultural and craft tools and comprises some 61,073 objects. Notable sections with it are Costume and textiles (14%), collected primarily on the basis of Bradford&#8217;s history in textile manufacturing, and domestic material (16%). There is also a small but significant collection of material relating directly to Cliffe Castle and the Butterfield family (3%)</p>
<h2>Photographic Archive</h2>
<p>A large collection of photographs and negatives, comprising of over 500,000 items, the largest part of this collection, approximately 350,000, was acquired by the service in 2004 from C.H. Wood Ltd. Another significant part of the collection is the Belle Vue Studio collection which consists of over 17,000 glass and film negatives and prints produced by the studio throughout its life. The bulk of the collection covers the period from 1950 until the studio closed in 1975, and predominately contains images of migrants that move to the Bradford district post World War two. The studio was particularly popular with the Ukrainian, South Asian and Caribbean communities living and working in the Bradford district.</p>

				     	<p>The Brunel Museum is housed in the Engine House and Tunnel Shaft, both elements of Marc Isambard Brunel’s Thames Tunnel, built between 1825-43, the first tunnel under a navigable river anywhere in the world. In 1975, a group of enthusiasts took on the task of restoring the former Engine House, to create displays and show collections related to the Tunnel and the Brunel family. The Brunel Museum became an accredited museum in 1991. Its collections were at first very small, largely on loan from other institutions. The Museum has always implemented a strict collections development policy with a view to developing a coherent collection, though it has expanded its focus to encompass the SS Great Eastern, a steamship launched by Isambard Kingdom Brunel at Millwall, just downriver from the Museum. Several items have been donated by individuals, including former Trustees and descendants of the Brunels.</p>

				     	<p>Chertsey Museum first opened to the public in 1965 as a voluntary run museum located on the first floor of the Old Town Hall in London Street. The original collections consisted of Chertsey Abbey floor tiles, Cypriot, Mycenaean and South Italian Greek pottery, furniture, local watercolours and photographs and some ethnographic material, all of which belonged to the Chertsey Urban District Council, plus material bequeathed by Mr. J. Tulk. This consisted of pottery, clocks and furniture. In addition to these collections, much material was donated by local individuals when it became known that a museum was being formed. Some of this material was of a non-local nature.</p>
<p>In 1969 the first professional Curator was appointed, and CM was offered the Olive Matthews collection of costume and accessories on long-term loan. However, the existing building was inadequate both in terms of storage and display of such a substantial collection. In 1970 the Trustees of the Olive Matthews Trust (OMT) purchased the present Museum building, The Cedars in Windsor Street, a grade 2 listed Regency Town House with an attractive rear garden. In 1972 OMT entered into an agreement with the Chertsey Urban District Council, allowing the display of both the Council’s and the OMT collections. The new Museum opened to the public in the same year.</p>
<p>As a result of local government re-organisation in 1974, the Chertsey Urban District Council and the Egham Urban District Council were amalgamated forming Runnymede Borough Council (RBC). RBC operates CM under the powers of the Public Libraries and Museums Act, 1964. Today, CM is managed as part of the Community Development Business Centre with the Community Development Committee of the Council as its governing body.</p>
<p>CM has built up a strong core of local public support, including the press and some local businesses. The Friends of Chertsey Museum was launched in 1994 to help raise the profile of CM locally, to help generate funds and to promote and support CM’s activities.</p>
<p>In May 2002 the museum relocated to temporary premises whilst The Cedars underwent a major refurbishment project, with the building of a new multi-purpose extension and the installation of a platform lift. For the first time Chertsey Museum has flat access throughout. The Museum re-opened at The Cedars in July 2003.</p>

				     	<p>The collections in total consist of approximately 24,400 objects. These are largely held at CM and off-site stores, or on display in The Cedars. Existing collection areas are outlined below:</p>
<h2>The Tulk Bequest (60 items)</h2>
<p>This collection of clocks, furniture and miscellaneous items were bequeathed by Mr J Tulk in 1962.</p>
<h2>The Runnymede Borough Collection (approximately 15,000 items)</h2>
<p>This collection consists mostly of material evidence related to the history of the Borough of Runnymede and environs. It includes; a horology collection of regional significance with local makers such as James Douglass and Henry Wale Cartwright represented; topographical paintings, prints and works on paper in addition to portraits of local civic and historic figures associated with the Borough, by artists including Robert Gallon, William Daniell and Joseph Farrington; archaeology from the Thames Valley of national significance, such as a Viking sword by the German maker Ulfberht and a Bronze Age socketed axe complete with wooden handle, the only one of its kind in Europe; medieval tiles and stone work from Chertsey Abbey; a geology collection of prehistoric animal bones and antlers from the Thames Valley; social history, including material relating to the Chertsey foundries, and documents and maps relating to the local area; and a collection of ancient Greek pottery.</p>
<h2>The Olive Matthews Collection of Costume &amp; accessories &amp; Decorative Arts (approximately 8,300 items)</h2>
<p>This collection is on long term loan from the Olive Matthews Trust who oversees its care and administration. The core of the collection is a group of costumes and accessories, ceramics, silver, furniture and clocks originally belonging to the late Miss Olive Matthews of Virginia Water. The costume collection consists of high quality fashionable English clothing from the period 1700 to the present, with one important item from the 17th century, an embroidered gentleman’s cap dating from between 1600 and 1610. Much of the material was acquired by Miss Matthews from the Old Caledonian Market in North London before 1939 and more rarely at auction sales. OMT’s remit allows it to seek significant additions to supplement the existing collection. This long-term loan collection was renewed for another 30 years in 2002.</p>
<h2>The Oliver Collection (approximately 1,200 items)</h2>
<p>This collection is on long term loan from the Oliver Trust, set up in 1985 to oversee the care and administration of the collection of Sydney Oliver of Egham, an antiques dealer, valuer and local historian. The collection consists of paintings and prints, photographs, ephemera, clocks and social history objects, many of local significance but also including non-local material. A 10-year loan agreement for this collection was originally entered into by RBC and OT in 1986. The loan was reviewed in 1994 and as a result was extended for a further 10 years to run from December 1996. The collection is currently under review, in consultation with OT, as part of the process of rationalisation.</p>

It consisted of social history paper-based artefacts dating from when the bridge opened in 1864 to the 1950s, such as postcards and prints featuring Clifton Suspension Bridge (approximately 800 items), as well as photographs and Victorian souvenirs, such as chinaware (approximately 50 artefacts). A further collection of contemporary items from companies using the bridge in their logo was acquired at this point.</p>
<p>Following the closure of the original Visitor Centre, the exhibition was rehoused in a temporary prefabricated building. In December 2014 a purpose-built museum located on the Leigh Woods side of the bridge was opened by HRH Princess Anne. The museum tells the story about the competition to design the bridge, its construction and completion and how it is maintained today. Original items from the Trust&#8217;s collections are used to tell this story and are part of the permanent display; they range from a piece of iron bar that was slung across the gorge by Brunel, to clay pipes found in the bridge&#8217;s vaults, to tickets and medallions commemorating the opening of the bridge in 1864, to an engineer&#8217;s notebook from the early twentieth century.</p>

				     	<p>The museum was set up in 1928 and arose from collections made by various individuals and groups including Elbolton Cave Material from Craven Naturalists, Elslack Roman Fort material from Lane-Fox, local history material collected by Fraser Dufty and Alfred Green and geological material collected by R H Tiddeman and Arthur Raistrick, as well as material purchased from the collection of John Sunderland. Arthur Raistrick built up a regional collection relating to lead mining. More collections have come to the museum over time including those of Colonel Tottie of Coniston Hall, W W Holgate of Earby. The collection has been added to by material from excavations and watching briefs in the Craven area. This includes material from the Friends of Craven Museum (1970s), Brian Hartley’s excavations at Kirk Sink Roman Villa, Gargrave (partially deposited here) and recent commercial archaeological deposits.</p>
<p>The Clement Roebuck collection of art was left to the town of Skipton on Roebuck’s death in 1988. Craven District Council supported the collection from 1989 and the collection formally came to Craven Museum and Gallery  in 2006.</p>
<p>An inventory and deaccessioning project was carried out in 2014-15. This was carried out with the help of the Museum Development Yorkshire and following ethical guidelines. Among other deaccessions, this enabled material to be transferred to other local museums and archives including Grassington Folk Museum and the North Yorkshire Archives at Northallerton.</p>
<p>From the initial setting up of the museum some material was only on loan and there are a number of legacy loans within the collection which we are currently trying to address to meet current standards. A legacy loan which continues to need to be managed is of the Elbolton Material from Craven Naturalists. This has been changed from a long term loan to a short term loan, which can be renewed at each review, but the lenders do not want to change it to a donation for historical reasons. We will continue to maintain close relations with the group.</p>

				     	<h2>Archaeology</h2>
<p>The archaeology collection at Craven Museum and Gallery ranges from Palaeolithic to post-Medieval and reflects the settlement and movement of people through Craven, an area partially within the Yorkshire Dales. Key collections are items relating to Elbolton and other cave excavations, the Malham Moor lithics, Elslack Roman fort, Kirk Sink Roman villa, Higher Land medieval moated house and the medieval timbers from the Red Lion in Skipton. We also have key collections from important sites near Grassington and Ingleton. The archaeology collections are of interest to national and local researchers as well as forming a collection in which local people take a close interest. Public consultation around the NLHF development work demonstrated significant interest in this area of the collection.</p>
<h2>Social and Industrial History</h2>
<p>Main strengths of the collection include lead mining, farming and textiles, -Dewhursts (Sylko Cotton) and other mills. Craven’s farming history for the 18th to early 20th century is particularly strongly represented. There is a small collection of toys and dolls from the early 19th to the early 20th century. Objects in the social and industrial history collections link strongly with the ephemera, photographic and oral history collections. In particular, there are both ephemera and objects which relate to the canal and railway in Craven in the 19th and 20th centuries. We have a small but significant collection relating to local trades and businesses in Craven including slaters, tailors, joiners and cloggers. These items range from 18th to 20th century. Significant individual items include the besom engine, the early 19th century lathe from Hetton and the lead ore crusher from Bishopdale.</p>
<p>There is also a significant small collection of items relating to Robert Thompson of Kilburn (Mouseman) which links with the Council Chamber furniture at Skipton Town Hall (entirely fitted out by Robert Thompsons of Kilburn).</p>
<p>We also have further small collections which reflect individual collectors’ interests from the early history of the museum. In a few cases these have been added to by subsequent collecting and include firearms, swords, snuff boxes, ceramics (lusterware and sample sanitaryware), horology (both clocks and pocket watches).</p>
<h2>Ethnographics</h2>
<p>We have a small ethnographic collection which reflects cultures world-wide and was mainly from the collections of W W Holgate.</p>
<h2>Costume and Textiles</h2>
<p>This collection contains c.170 items from the Upper Wharfedale Folk Museum (including a corded quilted waistcoat from 1730). We also have dresses made or bought locally from the 19th and 20th centuries including some children’s clothing associated with specific individuals. An additional small but significant collection are the 57 items which were worn by Mary Anne Teal from Cononley (1829 to 1904). We also have 45 samplers by local makers from the 18th and 19th century, mostly framed.</p>
<h2>Photographs, including glass plates</h2>
<p>The photograph collection is large including over 3,000 items. We also have c.500 glass plates. The spread of subject matter is wide including local people and buildings, famous places, landmarks, social history (including businesses and sports groups). There are glass lantern slides which reflect the talks and lectures given locally. We have two magic lanterns and cameras from a number of periods. In addition, we have 1,500 postcards relating to either Craven residents or the local area. This includes the Capstick/Hoggarth collection (871 items) which chronicles one family in Settle over several generations.</p>
<h2>Ephemera, Books and Documents</h2>
<p>The ephemera collection contains over 3,800 items plus 10 boxes which are currently being catalogued as part of the NLHF project (which runs until May 2021). Items date mainly from the 18th century to the present and include legal agreements and indentures, insurance documents, tickets, receipts, guidebooks, patterns, funeral cards, advertisements and Christmas and Birthday cards. Almost all the items reflect the Craven area or have Craven links.</p>
<p>Significant subcollections include the items collected by W W Holgate relating to his experiences in the Second World War and collections relating to local churches.</p>
<p>The most unusual and unique document within this collection is the diary of Richard Ryley. He records the impact of the cotton famine on his life as a cotton weaver and itinerant musician in the 1860s.</p>
<h2>Paintings, Prints and Drawings</h2>
<p>Paintings, prints and drawings include around 300 items, mainly framed, within this there are two specific collections: Clement Roebuck and Arthur Reginald Smith. The rest are works mainly relating to the local area or local artists and the collection includes the earliest known watercolour of Skipton by Anthony Devis.</p>
<p>The Roebuck Collection of 142 works includes a mix of oil paintings, watercolours, prints and drawings from the 17th to the mid 20th century. It’s core strength is the 20th century work. This includes works by: Edward Seago, Pierre Bonnard, John Piper, John Nash, Walter Sickert, Stanley Spencer, Grahame Sutherland, Laura Knight, Christopher Wood, Carel Weight and Jacobus Hendrick Pierneef. We have archive information and photographs which relate to his collecting pattern and connections with some of the artists. Although Clement Roebuck was originally from Huddersfield he spent much of his life in Craven, most notably at Starbotton where he encouraged artist friends of the mid 20th century to visit and paint the local area. His collection also reflects this local element as well as his wider collecting interests.</p>
<h2>Maps</h2>
<p>We have around 300 maps mainly stored flat, but some are framed or folded in book form. They relate to Craven and cover the geology, geography and archaeology of the area. 33 maps and plans relate to archaeology collections within the museum. The most significant items are two framed 18th century maps which relate to the building of the Leeds Liverpool Canal.</p>
<p>There are also a set of maps which belonged to the steward of Skipton Castle in the 19th century.</p>
<h2>Numismatics</h2>
<p>We hold items from Roman coinage through to pre-decimalisation coinage. Significant items include the Frankish tremissis from Holy Trinity Church Skipton and also the Hebden hoard of 33 denarii thought to be a Roman soldier’s pay. There are c.500 other coins including four other Elizabethan/Stuart coin hoards as well as other stray finds which we have purchased through the Portable Antiquities Scheme.</p>
<h2>Natural History</h2>
<p>This includes taxidermy specimens of birds, fish and mammals. Many of the birds are the remains of a once famous collection from Colonel Tottie of Coniston Hall. There is also a birds’ egg collection, begun in the 1840s which relates to Henry Roundell and Colonel Tottie and contains their notebooks about the collection. We have several other collections of birds eggs, shells, butterflies and moths which have been donated by Craven residents over the life of the museum, but the specimens themselves are from worldwide.</p>
<h2>Herbarium</h2>
<p>There are c.1,800 individual specimens mounted and labelled with the name of the collector and the date and place of collection. Notes are also made on the rareity of certain items at the time of collection. The collection was mainly in the late 19th century and early 20th century and spans a period of approximately 40-50 years. Most of the specimens relate to Craven but some are from further afield and there is a small collection of material from India. The herbarium contains specimens of plants which are now extremely rare such as the Lady’s Slipper Orchid. The herbarium relates particularly to the plants found in the unique limestone landscape of Craven.</p>
<h2>Geology</h2>
<p>There are approximately 200 trays and boxes of geological specimens. Many of these relate to the Craven area although some are from further afield. Most are from the collection of Arthur Raistrick who was a noted geologist and one of the founder members of the museum. Amongst his collection are minerals which relate to lead mining and plants from the coal measures. We also have four outsize aggregate specimens of fluorite which are very rare (due to their size).</p>
<h2>Oral History Recordings</h2>
<p>We have 110 oral history recordings relating to the Craven Area. These have been collected from the 1980s up to the present. All oral histories on tape cassette have now been digitised and we are in the process of transcribing all of our holdings.</p>

				     	<h2>Trust Overview</h2>
<p>Collections are a tangible link between the past, present and future. Museums, Archives and local history centres create a sense of pride for the residents of the city creating safe spaces to learn, create and belong. They balance the interests of a wide spectrum of people by safeguarding collections and making sure that they are well managed, sustainable and accessible. The key purpose of the Coventry City Council Collection is to help the people of Coventry and visitors to the city to explore and celebrate the creativity and cultural heritage of all its communities.</p>
<p>The Trust&#8217;s collections of more than 230,000 objects and artefacts are at the heart of the organisation and play a central role to the activities undertaken by the museums, such as Exhibitions and Events, Learning and Engagement, Corporate Hire, Marketing and Promotion. They are its unique selling point and its ‘raison d-etre&#8217;. Appropriate care and management of the collections underpin every aspect of museum activity and are essential to maximise their full potential.</p>
<h2>Coventry Transport Museum</h2>
<p>The Transport Museum opened in 1980&#8217;s when the road transport collection out grew its then home, the Herbert Art Gallery &amp; Museum. The museum is dedicated to collecting and exhibiting the products of a city that changed the transport world and focuses on the skills and innovation of its people; the majority of the collection is Coventry-built or has a strong connection with the city.</p>
<p>The museum aims to educate and inspire visitors through the history and development of vehicle manufacturing in Coventry over the last 150-years: highlighting Coventry&#8217;s transport heritage and its central place in the British car industry. The museum has 14 exhibition spaces that tell the stories of the people that lived and worked in the city through the road transport vehicles they produced.</p>
<p>The founding collection began with large cycle deposits and quickly began to include a vast array of motor vehicles. As the full story of Coventry&#8217;s manufacturing past began to grow through the collections a shift in focus began to move away from technical and general Road Transport to a core collections relating directly to Coventry.</p>
<p>In June 2015, a £9.5 million redevelopment of Coventry Transport Museum was completed, which has transformed 13 of its 14 exhibition spaces, including a new permanent World Land Speed Record Exhibition. The redevelopment also included the creation of expanded and redeveloped learning spaces and conference spaces, a temporary exhibition gallery, plus a new front entrance and retail site. Coventry Transport Museum&#8217;s internationally recognised and Designated Collection has been redisplayed within a radically redefined and redesigned layout.</p>
<h2>The Herbert Art Gallery &amp; Museum</h2>
<p>The Herbert Art Gallery &amp; Museum is named after Sir Alfred Herbert, a local industrialist who founded what was at one time the world&#8217;s largest machine tool making company. In 1938, Sir Alfred donated £100,000 to the City of Coventry to pay for the construction of an Art Gallery and Museum. Building work had started in 1939 but by the end of the war Coventry lay in ruins and work on the gallery was put on hold, although the basement was converted to a temporary art gallery in 1949. In 1954 Sir Alfred was finally able to lay the foundation stone of the new building, but sadly did not live to see its completion which finally opened on 9th March 1960.</p>
<p>The Herbert collections reflect the rich cultural heritage of Coventry, exploring the history of the people, places and events that constitute the city today. It has significant archaeology, social and industrial history, natural sciences and visual art collections.</p>
<p>The site also contains Coventry City archives collections; which includes a large photographic collection and oral history recordings.</p>
<p>A £20 million transformation and extension were completed in October 2008, jointly funded by the European Regional Development Fund, Heritage Lottery Fund Renaissance West Midlands, the Department for Culture Media and Sport, Wolfson Foundation Fund, Advantage West Midlands, English Heritage and Coventry City Council.</p>
<h2>The Lunt Roman Fort</h2>
<p>The Lunt Roman Fort was established in AD 60 is located in Baginton, about 3 miles from Coventry City centre. The Lunt Roman Fort was originally built in response to the Boudican Revolt but was only occupied for 20 years.</p>
<p>Archaeological exploration of the site began in the 1930s and by the 1960s it was decided to partially reconstruct the Fort. The Royal Engineers rebuilt the Eastern Gateway, the Gyrus and one of the granaries, before it was opened to the public in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Since the 1970s, a wealth of artefacts has been uncovered including bronze and iron work, pieces of armour and pottery and an extremely rare finial bowl. It is the only partially reconstructed wooden fort in Britain today. It is also home to the Gyrus, the only known horse training ring in the Roman Empire.</p>
<h2>Coventry City Archives</h2>
<p>Coventry Archives moved to the Herbert Art Gallery &amp; Museum in 2008 when the resources of Coventry Record Office and the local studies collection held at Central Library were brought together under one roof.</p>
<p>It houses a wide range of primary and secondary source material providing insights into the history of the city and its citizens from medieval times – the earliest record is dated 1182 &#8211; to the present day.</p>

				     	<h2>Coventry Transport Museum</h2>
<p>The collection was granted designation status in 1998 elevating the collections status to be of national significance.</p>
<p>All of the museum collections listed below are managed by Coventry Transport Museum and comprise the following subject areas:</p>
<h3>Vehicles</h3>
<p>The Motor Car collection of approximately 212 motor cars ranges from one of the earliest built Coventry cars of 1897, to one of the last of the Peugeot 206 cars to leave the Ryton Factory production line in December 2006. 90% of the vehicles were made in Coventry or have a very strong Coventry connection. There are a small number of vehicles without a direct Coventry connection that were collected before a tightening of the museum&#8217;s collecting policy or are significant vehicles which tell the wider story of the British Motor Industry.</p>
<p>The commercial vehicle collection of 46 items, including buses, lorries, vans, tractors, military vehicles and emergency vehicles, illustrates the involvement of Coventry companies in the manufacture of such vehicles and their everyday use in the city.</p>
<h3>Motorcycles</h3>
<p>The Motorcycle collections consists of 120 motorcycles ranging from early tri-cycles to the modern Triumph models and also includes bikes from around the world.</p>
<h3>Cycles</h3>
<p>This collection of over 400 items is one of the most significant collections of cycles in the country. It spans the period from 1818 to the present. It strongly reflects the involvement of the city in the manufacture of cycles in the latter half of the nineteenth century and the first quarter of the twentieth century. The collection also contains a number of more up to date cycles, sports and trade cycles.</p>
<h3>Transport Objects</h3>
<p>This collection comprises an unidentified number of items directly related to vehicles i.e. head lamps, radiator grills, engine parts, wheels, saddles etc. It also contains items related to the use of vehicles i.e. club badges, petrol pumps, garage equipment, street furniture, competition trophies etc.</p>
<h3>Technical Collection</h3>

This collection numbers around 1500 items.</p>
<p>Ribbon Weaving &#8211; This collection relates to Coventry&#8217;s ribbon and other narrow fabrics industry. The industry began at the end of the seventeenth century and was Coventry&#8217;s main industry until 1860. It continued to be an important industry after that and some production still takes place today. The collection consists of around 250 sample books; several thousand individual ribbons; around 1500 silk pictures and bookmarks (including one of the largest collections of Stevengraphs in the world); a nineteenth century jacquard loom and about 30 examples of weaving machinery and equipment).

It includes an Anderson air raid shelter, gas masks, ration books, Civil Defence uniforms, medals, utility furniture and much more.</p>
<h3>Archaeology</h3>
<p>This collection mainly relates to archaeological material and associated documentation from excavated sites within Coventry and on Coventry City Council owned land nearby, i.e. The Lunt Roman Fort, Baginton and Coombe Abby. Acquisition of this material is subject to procedural guidelines laid out in &#8216;Depositing Archaeological Archives&#8217; (internal document, 2017). The following categories comprise in total around 15,000 accessioned objects.</p>
<p>Prehistoric &#8211; This collection includes hand axes, arrowheads, hammers, microliths and cores, some of which are as old as the Palaeolithic period. There are also ceramics from the Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age.</p>
<p>Roman &#8211; This collection consists mainly of the material excavated from the Lunt Roman Fort at Baginton and dates from 60 to 80 AD. A small number of Roman objects and archaeology have also been recovered from the city and date between the first and the fourth centuries AD. However, most items are recovered from post-Roman stratigraphy. Material includes ceramics, military bronzes, coins and personal objects.</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxon &#8211; The collection comprises excavated material from the sixth century cemetery at Baginton and a quantity of late Saxon ceramic finds from various city centre sites. A small number of Viking-related objects are also included. From the Benedictine Priory, there is a small collection of late Saxon glazed wall tiles that are of national significance. An archaeological archive also exists for the Anglo-Saxon site at Ryton-on-Dunsmore which lies outside the city boundary. Its inclusion in The Herbert collections relates to the fact that the site was excavated by an amateur society with strong Coventry connections.</p>
<p>Medieval &#8211; At its peak in the late fourteenth and in the fifteenth century, Coventry was the fourth largest city in Britain outside London and the most important in the Midlands. The wool and cloth trades, markets and religious activity led to the growth of Coventry as a commercial hub. The collections include pottery, tiles, coins, painted window glass and building materials. A significant leather collection contains shoes, boots, a mask, a book cover, and archery equipment. There is also a collection of over one thousand architectural stones from the destroyed site of the Benedictine Priory, with the finely painted Apocalypse stones being of particular note. This is a particularly rich collection, which provides evidence for the city during what is considered to have been its ‘golden age&#8217;, and is the subject of a current Designation application.</p>
<p>Post Medieval &#8211; This collection comprises personal objects, building materials and ceramics from the Tudor period through to the nineteenth century. Some of this material overlaps with the social history collection.</p>
<p>Foreign Archaeology &#8211; Antiquarians who had strong links to Coventry contributed to many of the items in this collection. There is archaeological material from Egypt, Cyprus and Italy and also some representation of Aztec, African and Aboriginal cultures. Objects include pottery lamps, Egyptian funerary figures (&#8216;ushabties&#8217;), stone tools and jewellery.</p>
<p>The Shelton Collection &#8211; From the 1930s until his death in 1958, J.B. Shelton OBE collected objects associated with Coventry&#8217;s past. His small museum formed the basis of current archaeology collections. The collection includes a wide range of items including a notable fourteenth century vessel – the Coventry Face Jug.</p>
<p>Bulk finds &#8211; In addition to the small finds collections described above, there is also a large quantity of material from excavations from sites in Coventry dating back to the mid-twentieth century. This collection is currently being assessed for with a view to improving how it is stored and the information associated with it. Parts of the collection will also be considered for rationalisation.</p>
<h3>Natural Sciences</h3>
<p>The collection currently holds nearly 200,000 specimens in the following categories:</p>
<p>Bird eggs &#8211; There are about 13, 000 specimens. This collection is the ninth largest of its kind in Britain. Most breeding British species are represented and there are also a smaller number of exotic species.

				     	<h2>Perth Museum &amp; Art Gallery</h2>
<p>The history of Perth Museum &amp; Art Gallery collection and building begins with the Literary &amp; Antiquarian Society of Perth, which was founded in 1784. Its collections are amongst the oldest in public ownership and include an important body of ethnographic material, much of it acquired during the first half of the 19th century by men who left Perth as soldiers, sailors, ship&#8217;s surgeons, diplomats or travellers.</p>
<p>The Perthshire Society of Natural Sciences also played an important part in establishing its current holdings. Founded in 1867, it opened a Natural History Museum in Perth in 1883. In 1902 and 1914 both collections were transferred to Perth Town Council. In 1926 major bequests of paintings and funds of Robert Brough and Robert Hay Robertson enabled the substantial extension of the Literary &amp; Antiquarian Museum to include art galleries and lecture rooms. It was opened in 1935 and now houses the collections of both earlier museums as well as many more recent acquisitions.</p>
<h2>Alyth Museum</h2>
<p>The origins of the small local history museum at Alyth in north east Perthshire lie with the establishment of a library following a bequest from the late Hon William Ogilvy of Loyal in1870. Alyth Folk Museum came into existence a century later after the library building had been vacated. Finding a future use for the redundant building, it was agreed that it would be suitable to establish a folk museum within the framework of the Loyal Alyth Public Library Trust. It is currently held in Trust by the Local Authority under a Cy Pres scheme approved by the Court of Session in 1981. Collections not on display are housed in Perth Museum &amp; Art Gallery and managed and cared for along with the reserve collections.</p>
<h2>The Fergusson Gallery</h2>
<p>The Fergusson Gallery building was originally built in 1832 as Perth&#8217;s first water works. Since 1992, the Grade A listed building has housed a significant collection of work by the Scottish artist John Duncan Fergusson, plus an associated archive. The collection was gifted by the J D Fergusson Art Foundation, along with the copyright of Fergusson&#8217;s work. In 2010 this was joined by a substantial archive relating to the life and work of his partner, the modern dance pioneer, Margaret Morris.</p>

				     	<h2>Fine Art</h2>
<p>The Fine Art collection owes its existence largely to the 1926 bequests of local patrons Robert Hay</p>
<p>Robertson and Robert Brough, although the first painting entered the collection as early as 1785. The Fine Art collection is international in its scope and numbers over 4,000 items. The greatest strength of the Fine Art collection is its holding of Scottish works, which is particularly rich in 19th century paintings, including pictures by local artists, local topographical views and portraits of local individuals.</p>
<p>There are also a number of key works of the earlier 20th century, but by far the most important representation for this period is the exceptionally rich collection of artwork and archive pertaining to the life and work of John Duncan Fergusson. This was further strengthened since its donation in 1992, with examples of work by those in his social circle in Glasgow in the mid-20th century and the vast Margaret Morris Archive pertaining to the artist, dancer and choreographer, with whom his life was so closely associated.</p>
<h3>Scottish Art</h3>
<p>Key pictures in the Scottish Art collection include three oil paintings by John Everett Millais, <em>Loch Katrine </em>by Horatio McCulloch and D Y Cameron&#8217;s <em>The Wilds of Assynt.</em></p>
<p>The donation of artworks, including examples by John Maxwell, James Cowie, Sir William Gillies, Jack Knox, Robert Colquhoun and Ian Hamilton Finlay (via the Scottish Arts Council Bequest of 1998) helped fill several notable gaps in the 20th century collection and added significant pictures.Other important 20th century artists represented in the collection include Joan Eardley, Joyce Cairns, John Bellany, John Byrne, William Crosbie, Barbara Rae, Doug Cocker, Claire Harkess, Derrick Guild and Donald Urquhart.</p>
<p>The Scottish drawing and print collection includes examples by Muirhead Bone, Duncan Robertson, Peter Kirley, Philip Reeves, Marj Bond, Calum Mackenzie and Campbell Sandilands.</p>
<p>During the 1990s the collection was enhanced by a quantity of archival material of relevance to local artists, including the diary of Blairgowrie artist William Geddes and the travel diary of John Milne Purvis of Perth. Where such material survives it can contribute significantly to our understanding of the activities of an individual artist and throw insight into their contemporaries, lifestyle and specific era.</p>
<h3>British and Foreign Schools</h3>
<p>The Fine Art collection has a comparatively small amount of non-Scottish picture, but contains some very important works which are of strong local relevance, such as the oil paintings by Edwin Henry Landseer and John Everett Millais and the watercolours by Helen Beatrix Potter. Other English artists such as Copley Fielding and Sutton Palmer are also represented by local topographical views.</p>
<p>Also of note are Dutch and Flemish paintings and a number of French works which include two important drawings by Millet and oils by Courbet and Boudin. There are also early Italian paintings and occasional 19th century Italian, Hungarian and Chilean pieces.</p>
<p>The Dutch and French collection reflects the close ties between Scotland and these countries, especially in the development of 19th century Scottish painting and the collecting of contemporary Dutch examples by Scottish collectors.</p>
<p>In addition there is a small but strong collection of Japanese woodblock prints which were also influential in the development of western art in the late 19th century.</p>
<h3>The Fergusson Collection and Margaret Morris Archive</h3>
<p>The Fergusson Gallery Collection is of international significance. The collection includes over 4,000 individual works of art, comprising oil paintings, works on paper, sketchbooks and sculpture by Scottish artist, J D Fergusson, who is now celebrated as one of the leading figures in the development of European Modernism in the first half of the 20th century. Key items include large scale paintings such as <em>At My Studio Window</em>, <em>Etude de Rhythm,</em> <em>Christmas Time in the South of France</em> numerous selfportraits and the sculpture titled <em>Eastre, Hymn to the Sun</em>.</p>
<p>In addition, the collection includes a substantial related archive consisting of around 6,000 items, such as press cuttings, letters, photographs, exhibition catalogues periodicals, magazines and Fergusson&#8217;s personal library books.</p>
<p>In 2010 acceptance of the major gift of the Margaret Morris Archive effectively doubled the Fergusson Gallery collection. The Margaret Morris Archive includes oil paintings, watercolours, drawings, sketches, photographs, costume, costume and stage set designs and much archival material relating to the life of the modern dance pioneer, Margaret Morris, who was also J D Fergusson&#8217;s partner.</p>
<p>There is also a small collection of works of art relating to Fergusson&#8217;s circle in Glasgow in the 1940s and 1950s. Plus an increasing collection of contemporary work (paintings, mixed media, sculpture and ceramics) by winners of the J D Fergusson Arts Award, since its inaugural award in 1997.</p>
<h3>Sculpture</h3>
<p>The sculpture collection numbers less than 100 items, many on a small scale. Key items are an important life-size marble figure of <em>Paris</em> by John Gibson, two key pieces by Eric Gill, and a group of bronzes and maquettes by Alfred Gilbert. Local sculptors are represented by Lawrence Macdonald, Mary Grant, George Washington Andrew Kinloch Smyth, Alastair Ross, Evelyn Temple, Duncan Robertson and John Hunter. The collection also includes pieces of relevance to the area, such as the bust of William Soutar by Benno Schotz, that of Alex MacDuff of Bonhard by William Brodie, the bronze bust of Hamish Henderson by Anthony Morrow or the maquettes for some pieces of public art within Perth and Kinross. Also included are contemporary sculpture-boxes by local artists Doug Cocker, Susan Mear, Grant Clifford and Fred Stiven.</p>
<h3>Illustrated Books</h3>
<p>Over the years a number of illustrated volumes have been acquired for the collection where they broaden an understanding of a specific artist (for example a book illustrated by William McCance who is represented by individual prints in the collection). They are acquired also where they are of relevance to the Perth and Kinross area (for example books containing plates of local topography which may be represented otherwise only by odd individual plates in the collection, such as Thomas Campbell&#8217;s <em>Tour in Scotland</em>). Other volumes have been acquired which are inscribed by, and occasionally decorated by local artists. Finally there are those books written and illustrated by local artists such as the volumes of poetry by Douglas Spens Steuart.</p>
<h2>Applied Art</h2>
<p>The Applied Art collection encompasses a wide variety of objects and materials. The collections of Perth silver and Perthshire glass are unsurpassed in terms of national importance. The ceramics collection contains significant collections of Staffordshire flat-back figures and Martinware studio pottery as well as a collection of studio pottery, produced by potters native to or resident in the Perth and Kinross area. Other smaller collections include furniture, timepieces, oriental and other items.</p>
<p>The non-Perth applied art objects enhance and complement the Perth material by providing examples which illustrate the evolution of style and allow material to be placed in an art historical context. The Applied Art collection represents quality contemporary crafts from Scotland, with emphasis on local makers, to illustrate Scotland&#8217;s rich indigenous crafts tradition.</p>
<h3>Glass</h3>
<p>This includes laboratory and lighting glassware manufactured by Moncrieff&#8217;s of Perth, examples of Monart and Vasart glass made in Perth c1924-1962 and the Ross collection of paperweights, the majority of which are of local manufacture. The collection also includes historic and contemporary material of local manufacture or relevance produced by Perthshire Paperweights, Strathearn Glass, Paul Ysart, Colin Terris, Stuart Strathearn and Caithness Glass.</p>
<p>In addition to local glass the collection contains Venetian Glass and about 100 pieces of British glass (mainly 19th century in date) and a small selection of modern studio glass of Scottish origin.</p>
<p>Contemporary has been purchased from smaller glass workshops and local makers located in the Perth and Kinross area. Key contemporary pieces include Carrie Fertig&#8217;s life sized <em>Black-faced</em><em> Sheep </em>and <em>Glare</em> by Rachel Elliot.</p>
<p>As well as finished items, material related to the process of glass making has been acquired, including objects in stages of production, millefiori and picture canes, motifs for paperweights and tools.</p>
<h3>Silver</h3>
<p>There are over 500 pieces of silver which date from the 17th to the 21st centuries. Over half of the items are of Perth manufacture, including important items by local historic makers as well as contemporary examples. These are complimented by non-Perth material, which are illustrative of the wider evolution of styles and decoration. They include examples from Edinburgh, Birmingham, Sheffield, London, and some foreign material from Holland, Norway, America, Sweden and India.</p>
<h3>Ceramics</h3>
<p>The most comprehensive element of the ceramics collection is modern pottery, background information and ephemera produced by or connected with potters active in Perth and Kinross. This was actively collected from 1989, with over 180 items by 13 studio potters acquired plus 26 items by the commercial pottery of A W Buchan and Company. Historic pottery made or decorated in the Perth area has also been acquired.</p>
<p>The collection also includes 19th century Scottish and English ceramics. This includes a collection of</p>
<p>Staffordshire flat-back figures and about 50 pieces of Southall and London ceramics by the notable Martin Brothers as well as other occasional pieces of significance or rarity. There are also a small number of foreign pieces.</p>
<h3>Furniture and Timepieces</h3>
<p>There are about 80 pieces of furniture (excluding long case clocks) which stem largely from the Sir D Y Cameron and Lady Riddell bequests of 1946.</p>
<p>There are a collection of 18 long case clocks, including a very fine local musical example and a chinoiserie laquered case clock by Quare and Horsman. There are also a small number of pocket watches (some with local watchpapers in situ) and assorted other clocks, or clock parts, including the Perth Town clock face by Toschack. The majority of the long case clocks and some of the other items are by local clockmakers, or are otherwise associated with Perth and Kinross.</p>
<h3>Metalwork (non-silver)</h3>
<p>This group of material includes brass, copper, pewter and plated wares (it excludes objects made from silver and silver gilt which are covered earlier). Included in the collection are a number of pieces of the unrivalled and important group of church plate from St John&#8217;s Kirk in Perth, including pewter vessels, which was acquired in 2003 with generous financial assistance from the heritage Lottery Fund and the Art Fund. It also incorporates secular material such as presentation gifts and trophies and communion plate, mostly of local manufacture or association.</p>
<h3>Oriental</h3>
<p>This collection is small and disparate. Most important, is a small but highly significant collection relating to the Ainu people of Northern Japan. It also includes material from India, China, Burma, Nepal, Formosa, Persia, Turkey, Egypt and Tibet (excluding ceramics and Japanese prints which are dealt with above). Objects range from carved, marble deities and large brass Buddha figures to personal ornaments, weapons, and models of human figures, animals and houses.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Social History</h3>
<p>The rich and varied Social History collection of over 7,500 items covers a wide range of material from c1600 to the present day. A large proportion of the social history collection has a direct association with the Perth and Kinross area. It includes industrial and agricultural machinery, modes of transport and communication, shop fittings, photographic and textile equipment, models, medical, musical and scientific instruments, commemorative and ornamental items, toys, games and sports equipment, weights and measures, religious and educational items and everyday domestic material.</p>
<h3>Archaeology</h3>
<p>The archaeological collection spans a chronology encompassing approximately 10,000BC to AD 1700 and comprises Scottish, British and international material. Scottish and British material is generally confined to individual items or small groups of objects relating to the area of Perth and Kinross. The exceptions are the site archives for excavations and watching briefs on medieval sites in Perth from the 1970s onwards.</p>
<p>The amount and the quality of this medieval material make it the major area of importance within the archaeology collections and of national and international significance. With the exception of the Medieval period the collection remains weak particularly for the Iron Age, Roman and early historic periods.</p>
<p>The individual finds in the collection were historically acquired by donation, with a small number of purchases. The majority are now acquired as purchases through the allocation by the Crown Office via Scottish Treasure Trove Law. Formerly excavation assemblages were allocated via the Finds Disposal Panel but this has now been combined with the Treasure Trove Panel, forming the Scottish Archaeological Finds Allocation Panel, which deals with all allocations.</p>
<p>The British archaeology also includes good collections of Bronze Age pottery and metalwork and good collections of flint donated by James Roberts and Mary Boyle in 1962.</p>
<p>The international archaeology comprises a small collection of Cypriot pottery and glass bequeathed by Melville-Gray in 1946, a small collection of Egyptian material (notably a Mummy and its sarcophagus), and a collection of prehistoric flints from Somalia donated by Seton-Karr in 1903.</p>
<h3>Arms and Armour</h3>
<p>This is a varied collection of 450 British and foreign firearms, swords and daggers, staff weapons, shot and powder flasks and armour. It includes a small collection of arms donated by Sir William Burrell in 1940 and a bequest by Melville-Gray in 1946. The collection contains some notable pieces, for example, a pair of pistols by McNab of Rannoch and one Highland targe in excellent condition.</p>
<h3>Costume and Textiles</h3>
<p>This collection includes 3,000 individual items or groups of items and comprises costume, textiles and accessories.</p>
<p>Notable items include local militia uniforms; a 17th century Perth dance costume; a Perth Incorporation banner of 1604; a 17th century tablecloth (which is an early Scottish example of weaving and dyeing) and an important gent&#8217;s slashed silk doublet of the early 1620s. The collections of shawls, samplers, banners and fans are also significant.</p>
<p>The collection comprises mainly ladies costume with some notable 18th century Spittalfield silk dresses, but gents&#8217; costume includes a collection of theatrical costume worn by the actor Sir John Martin Harvey. It is strong in ladies&#8217; costume for the period 1940-1970 but there is a marked absence of material for the period 1800-1850 and earlier.</p>
<h3>Books and Archives</h3>
<p>The large collection of printed books and journals dates from the 17th century to the present day. It includes books that were part of the free library set up by the Literary &amp; Antiquarian Society of Perth and books acquired by the Perth Town Council Museum Service since 1900. The library of the Perthshire Society of Natural Science is also housed within Perth Museum &amp; Art Gallery under a legal agreement between the Society and Perth &amp; Kinross Council (but does not form part of the Museum&#8217;s collections).</p>
<p>The archive comprises over 4,000 catalogued archives or groups of archival items. They include manuscript, and printed material, bound volumes, bundles of archives and a number of framed and glazed items. There is also a collection of 550 maps and plans and a collection of 180 posters.</p>
<p>The archives are mainly of local relevance and include the papers of one of the forerunners of today&#8217;s Museums &amp; Galleries Service &#8211; the Literary and Antiquarian Society of Perth, 1784-1914. Other notable items include archives of the Hammermen and Wrights Incorporations of Perth, the William de Brailes illuminated Bible (c1240); the Sermons of Jacques de Vitry (15th century); and a book of hours, possibly French (15th century).</p>
<p>Archival material acquired in recent years is primarily ephemera associated with the Perth and Kinross area which complements the other social history collections, eg Stagecoach bus tickets or archives relating to the history of the Museums &amp; Galleries Service and its collections.</p>
<h3>Coins, Medals and Stamps</h3>
<p>The numismatic collection includes Scottish and British coinage, Classical coinage, trade and church tokens and also medals, stamps, seals and a number of miscellaneous items such as beggars&#8217; badges.</p>
<p>The Church tokens mainly comprise a collection of communion tokens donated by D L Edwards in 1951.</p>
<p>The collection also includes a representative collection of military medals and some commemorative medals.</p>
<p>The stamp collection is mainly composed of a collection bequeathed by Spence-Smith in 1951 of mostly British material with some foreign stamps and some early postmarks.</p>
<h3>Photography</h3>
<p>The Photography collection includes examples of many of the photographic processes used since photography&#8217;s invention.</p>
<p>These include examples of the earliest processes; the Daguerreotype and calotype. The latter being the work of renowned photographic pioneers D O Hill (an artist of Perth origin) and Robert Adamson.</p>
<p>A significant collection of collodion wet plate negatives created by Perth photographer Magnus Jackson comprising circa 2,500 images forms the earliest photographic record of Perth and Perthshire. Amongst the varied subject matter his award-winning tree portraits are of particular note.</p>
<p>Other collections of note include a series of dry plate negatives comprising postcard views of Perthshire taken by several local photographers between 1903 and 1923. Wood &amp; Son Printers, Perth, published these as the Woodall Series of black and white and hand coloured postcards.</p>
<p>A recently acquired collection of over 13,000 (mostly glass) negatives taken between 1927 and 1993 from the business of D Wilson Laing Photographers, Blairgowrie is a powerful record of life in Eastern Perthshire.</p>
<p>Our biggest single collection of images comprises around 100,000 negatives taken from 1948 to the 1990s by Perth freelance press businesses Alex Cowper, and later Louis Flood Photographers.</p>
<p>There are also significant collections of lantern slides (mainly accumulated by previous museum curators for educational purposes), prints, albums and postcards. Notable amongst the albums is one from 1903 which commemorates the formation of the Scottish Photographic Federation, an event which took place on 17 January 1903 in the Natural History Museum on Tay Street.</p>
<p>The photography collections are a unique medium in themselves, as a social document, in their ability to record changes in the environment and in their facility to enhance other collections and provide a powerful medium of interpretation.</p>
<h2>World Cultures</h2>
<p>The World Cultures or Ethnography collection was built on a nucleus of material donated to the Literary &amp; Antiquarian Society of Perth in the early 19th century. Of these donations there were two notable collections made by Dr Ramsay and presented in 1825 and Colin Robertson, presented in 1833. Significant donations made in the 20th century include collections donated by Dixon in 1917 and Woodward in the 1950s.</p>
<p>There are over 1,300 individual items or groups of items in the collection; over half are from Oceania, the remainder being American and African. Notable pieces include a rare Tahitian mourner&#8217;s costume, a unique Kakapo feather cloak from New Zealand and a collection of important items from North America including Salish cloaks, a Chilkat apron, Haida argillite carvings and Salish bracelets and combs.</p>
<p>The World Cultures collection was published in catalogue form in 1980 and 2 Toi Moko were repatriated by Perth &amp; Kinross Council to Te Papa (The National Museum Service of New Zealand) in 2005.</p>
<h2>Natural History</h2>
<p>This large and important collection of zoological, botanical and geological material totals around 150,000 specimens. It is the 6th largest collection of natural history in Scotland. The richness of the collection is largely thanks to the founding of the Perthshire Society of Natural Science in 1867 and the opening of the Perthshire Natural History Museum in 1881.</p>
<p>A major focus for the collections has always been to collect and preserve specimens and information covering the wildlife and geology of Perthshire and Kinross-shire. Locally collected specimens serve as vouchers for published studies. The historical collections also have considerable comparative material from elsewhere in Scotland and Britain and from overseas.</p>
<p>For ease of consideration the Natural History collection has been sub-divided into zoology, botany and geology.</p>
<p>The Natural History collections also include local environmental records that document the occurrence of plant and animal species and sites of wildlife or geological interest.</p>
<p>Perth Museum &amp; Art Gallery holds a certificate under European Council Regulation No 338/97 and European Commission Regulation 939/97 on the protection of species, enabling it to hold and display specimens of Annex A species listed in CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild flora and fauna). It also holds a licence under the Conservation (Natural Habitats etc) Regulations 1994 to possess any European Protected Species for science, research or educational purposes.</p>
<h3>Zoology</h3>
<h4>Mammals</h4>
<p>This collection consists of about 500 specimens of which the majority are British and collected in Perthshire. It includes a British skin collection, mounted trophy heads, British and exotic mounts.</p>
<h4>Birds</h4>
<p>The bird collection comprises about 2,500 taxidermy mounts and about 1,300 study skins. This is a representative collection of British taxa and the collection is strong in specimens from Perthshire.</p>
<p>The most important collection is the study skins of John Guille Millais (1865-1931). There are good examples of the work of local and well known taxidermists including Charles Kirk (1872-1922) and George Hart (d 1940?), a taxidermist with the Perth firm of P D Malloch. The overseas material includes a notable collection from Paraguay obtained from local collector, William Foster (1873-1915) and smaller collection from Ecuador. There are about 2,000 British eggs, about 200 foreign clutches or single eggs, and about 200 nests. A further strength is the specimens of casual visitors and rare species in Perthshire and Angus.</p>
<h4>Fish, Amphibians, Reptiles</h4>
<p>This small group of collections contains about 200 fish, reptiles and amphibians. The fish collection is lacking in representative specimens of smaller local species, though it contains notable examples of local game fish prepared by the Perth taxidermy firm of P D Malloch.</p>
<p>The amphibian and reptile collection is not large and consists largely of foreign specimens with a few local specimens preserved in spirit.</p>
<h4>Skeletal Collection</h4>
<p>This collection consists about 700 specimens of articulated and disarticulated animal skeletons and single bones or skulls of vertebrates. There is a mixture of British and foreign material. The largest skeleton is that of the extinct moa from New Zealand. The collection includes an articulated human skeleton, skull and detached bones. These are commercial preparations and have no known association with any particular community.</p>
<h4>Invertebrates</h4>
<p>This is the largest collection, comprising over 95,000 specimens from many sources. Particular strengths are the collections of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) and Hemiptera (true bugs).</p>
<p>Some invertebrate groups such as insects and molluscs are well represented, while others, such as spiders, are poorly represented.</p>
<p>The Lepidoptera collection contains about 40,000 specimens, with the majority from Britain, Scotland and Perthshire. There are approximately 5,000 foreign specimens. The most important collection is that of Francis Buchanan White (1842-1894). The strong Perthshire collection is the largest and most complete of its kind and includes voucher specimens of Scottish rarities. Other important named collections are those of Samuel Ellison (d 1939), Sir Thomas Moncreiffe (1822-1879) and David Coates (d 1980). The Coates collection contains specimens collected between 1960 and 1980 around Stirling and Aberfoyle.</p>
<p>The Hemiptera collection contains 8,280 specimens collected around the world with about 3,000 from Britain. Material came from collectors in New Zealand, Brazil, France, Madeira and the East Indies, including specimens from Alfred Russell Wallace (1823-1919), who co-discovered the theory of evolution. It is the most significant insect collection at Perth because it includes 13 type specimens and associated series of overseas specimens. The collection was brought together by the leading Scottish naturalist, Francis Buchanan White (1842-1894).</p>
<p>The mollusc collection is a large and representative collection of 20,000 specimens of 1,940 species. The collection is the 5th largest mollusc collection in Scotland. Henry Coates (1859-1935) published a catalogue of the collection in 1925 and was a major donor. The British land and freshwater mollusca (1,108 specimens) were collected between 1832 and 2006. There are good voucher specimens, including rarities, for Perthshire and other parts of Britain. The British marine shells total 871 specimens. They were collected in the period 1857 to1925. There are 17,000 specimens in the collection of foreign land, freshwater and marine shells. Main provenances are the Andes, Guyana, New Hebrides, West Indies, Red Sea, Philippines, Eastern Seas and the Arctic.</p>
<h3>Botany</h3>
<p>The botanical collections comprise about 45,000 specimens consisting of a large herbarium of vascular plants and a small collection of fungi and non-vascular plants. This is the 5th largest botanical collection in Scotland.</p>
<p>The vascular plants are housed in a number of named herbaria.</p>
<p>The <em>‘Perthshire&#8217;</em> herbarium is a significant resource of voucher specimens for Perthshire on which the published <em>‘Flora of Perthshire&#8217;</em> is based. This is the largest collection of Perthshire plants in the world. The <em>‘Perthshire&#8217;</em> herbarium contains 12,931 specimens collected in the three Perthshire vice-counties. They were collected from 1810 to 2001, with the main period of collecting being 1868-1893 by Francis Buchanan White (1842-1894) and other members of the Perthshire Society of Natural Science.</p>
<p>The <em>‘Balfour&#8217;</em> herbarium contains about 14,000 specimens of which approximately 50% are from</p>
<p>Scotland, 25% from England, and the final 25% from overseas, including France, Italy, Switzerland, India, USA and Australia. The specimens were collected from 1765-1873, with the main period of collecting being 1821-1862. The collection was presented to the Literary &amp; Antiquarian Society of Perth in 1880 and came from the <em>‘botany classroom&#8217;</em> of the University of Edinburgh, at the Botanic Garden, where it was used as a teaching collection.</p>
<p>The <em>‘Non-Perthshire&#8217;</em> herbarium contains about 6,000 specimens from Britain and Europe.</p>
<p>The <em>‘Buchanan White&#8217;</em> Willow Herbarium contains 2,600 specimens of Willows (<em>Salix</em>) collected in Perthshire, other parts of Scotland and Britain. Buchanan White was a willow specialist and in 1889 published a <em>‘Revision of British Willows&#8217;</em>.</p>
<p>Specimen data for significant elements of the Herbaria collections are accessible via the internet on <a href="http://herbariaunited.org/"><strong>http://herbariaunited.org/</strong></a></p>
<h3>Geology</h3>
<h4>Rocks</h4>
<p>The rock collection consists of about 2,000 specimens from Perth and Kinross, Britain and Europe. In general, local rock types are well represented, though coverage of British sedimentary rocks for comparison is poor. Foreign specimens consist mainly of ornamental types and volcanic rocks from Vesuvius.</p>
<h4>Minerals</h4>
<p>This collection of about 3,000 specimens contains a high proportion of non-local material, for example, specimens from Russia, Australia and America.</p>
<h4>Fossils</h4>
<p>The Fossil collection includes about 2,500 specimens from Perth and Kinross and Britain and contains specimens of historical and scientific importance. The most significant and rare specimens are fossils collected in Angus, Perthshire and Fife including Carboniferous plants, Lower Devonian eurypterids (sea-scorpions), fish, plants and alga, and Pleistocene mammals such as elk, beaver and aurochs.</p>
<h3>Models</h3>
<p>The Museums &amp; Galleries Service possesses 200 models that were originally acquired for display purposes. Many are of a very high quality and are of historic interest. They include botanical models by Brendel, glass models of invertebrates by Blaschka and plaster models of protists by Fric.</p>
<h3>Environmental Records</h3>
<p>The Museums &amp; Galleries Service holds biological and geological information relating to sites, habitats, strata and the distribution of the flora and fauna in Perth and Kinross. This data increases the understanding of our environment and contributes to its conservation. The Museums &amp; Galleries Service is unable to resource an Environmental Records Centre. In the absence of a dedicated records centre for this part of Scotland we will continue to act as a holding archive for such records until such time as a dedicated centre becomes established.</p>

				     	<p>The Society owns a wide collection of artefacts and literature ranging from diving-related toys to diving bells, and from diving company catalogues to scientific publications on diving research. They cover all aspects of diving: sport, scientific, commercial, archaeological, naval, entertainment, and diving history.</p>
<p>A major part of the John Bevan Collection, which was previously on display in the Shipwreck and Heritage Centre at Charlestown, in Cornwall, was loaned to us in order to establish The Diving Museum. This included most of the outside exhibits, such as diving bells, a 1930s atmospheric diving suit, a two-man swimmer delivery vehicle designed for the Royal Navy, and two compression chambers which were from the Royal Naval Physiological Laboratory. John&#8217;s collection has since been formally donated to The Diving Museum. The RN Diving Branch loaned several types of underwater breathing apparatus, and the National Museum of the Royal Navy loaned a selection of important historical items and artwork originally from the Siebe Gorman Diving Museum. They also loaned us and then passed to our collection a JIM atmospheric diving suit and a wooden scale model of Argonaut Junior, a 3-wheeled seabed vehicle originally made in 1894 in America, which incorporated an airlock. Many diving-related organisations, members of the Historical Diving Society and other individuals have donated or loaned a wide variety of diving equipment and accessories, in particular, the late Bob Campbell&#8217;s important collection of SCUBA regulators has been donated to The Diving Museum. Other important donations include a 3-metre scale model of the wreck of HMS Edinburgh made for the film Gold from the Deep donated by Rick Wharton; another atmospheric diving suit, a Newt Suit, and a fully equipped saturation diver and bellman were donated by Subsea 7; and QinetiQ have donated a large quantity of diving equipment that had been used for evaluation purposes over many years. Military medals and ephemera relating to Lt. W. Bailey, Cdr. L. Crabb and Stoker Sydney Knowles, famous divers from WW2, have been loaned by their respective families and, in the case of Cdr. Crabb&#8217;s medal, by the National Museum of the Royal Navy.</p>
<p>A large number of books have been donated and The Historical Diving Society now has an extensive reference and research library of some 5000 books, documents and photographs. Our archives include Royal Naval diver training records going back to 1921, several personal divers&#8217; logs, commercial diving equipment catalogues and scientific publications on diving research. We also have about 500 films and videos, and about 2500 items of diving apparatus and related items.</p>
<p>We use a database for cataloguing, managing, and tracking all objects, in which every object is given a unique number. Each entry includes a 1-line description and if necessary additional notes which can be considerably longer, as well as other details of the item and of its acquisition. In January 2023 the total number of items recorded exceeded 9000.</p>
<p>All our paper and film artefacts are kept in our concrete storeroom familiarly known as The Bunker, a Second World War Air Raid Precaution Centre now owned by the HDS, which has a suitable and stable environment. It is located about a mile from The Diving Museum.</p>

				     	<h2>Archaeology Collection</h2>
<p>This collection reflects the rich archaeological heritage of Dorset. Important collections presented to the museum include those of: Cunnington (1880s); Moule (1880-1900); Warne (1880); and Hall and Bean (1982). The prehistoric and Roman collections are particularly strong. The archaeology of the iron age hillfort of Maiden Castle, excavated primarily by Sir Mortimer Wheeler, is a strength of the museum. There are finds from many major excavations in Dorchester and rural Dorset, such as the evidence for the neolithic henge monument at Maumbury Rings, subsequently a Roman amphitheatre (and latterly a 17th century gun emplacement); artefacts from the huge late neolithic palisade enclosure which underlies Dorchester; finds from prehistoric excavations elsewhere in the county; finds from the Roman town of Durnovaria, which underlies modern Dorchester, and the many Dorset rural Roman settlements and villas; Saxon finds from cemeteries such as Poundbury; and medieval material from the county. In addition, there is a fine range of artefacts discovered as stray finds, especially perhaps bronze age metalwork. There are complete Roman mosaic pavements lifted from town houses excavated in Dorchester and from Dewlish Roman villa.</p>

				     	<p>The Fitzwilliam Museum owes its foundation to Richard, 7th Viscount Fitzwilliam of Merrion, who in 1816 bequeathed his works of art and his library to the University together with the funds for a building in which to house them. The Museum opened to the public on its current site in 1848: from that date to the present, the founding collection (of paintings, prints, books and manuscripts) has been repeatedly extended through bequest, gift and purchase. Notable additions over the last 200 years include the Disney collection of Classical sculpture, the McClean collection of coins and manuscripts, the Glaisher collection of European ceramics, John Charrington&#8217;s print collection and the wide-ranging assortment of fine and applied arts and antiquities bequeathed by Charles Ricketts and Charles Shannon. The Museum also has important holdings of contemporary art and craft, acquired through purchase and donation.</p>

				     	<p>When the Service was established in 1986 it inherited a number of existing collections about the local area from internal departments, notably the Arts &amp; Entertainment Service, Library Service, Hackney Archives and the Mayor’s Office, as well as the Chalmers collection. In its desire to build the collection, reflect the Borough’s ethnic and cultural diversity and attract further donations, the Museum team at the time collected extensively and without discrimination to reflect the lives and histories of all the Borough’s residents. Many of the items were a reflection of Hackney at the time such as posters, ephemera and photographs as well as objects. Many of these items were related to the social and cultural history of the borough of Hackney, which formed the basis of the Museum’s permanent displays in Central Hall.</p>
<p>The second Hackney Museum in 2002 worked closely with community collecting panels and gave them support, funds and means to collect objects to represent the experiences of members of specific ethnic and cultural communities in the Borough. These partnerships informed the team’s development of the content for the current permanent displays, which tell a narrative of migration and settlement to Hackney over the past 2,000 years.</p>
<p>From 2002 to 2008 Hackney Museum’s collecting was largely passive and the majority of our acquisitions were the result of unsolicited offers from the public. Since 2008 there has been more emphasis on active collecting, in relation to exhibitions and projects such as Mapping the Change (2009 &#8211; 2012) and Our Museum (2012 &#8211; 2015) as well as documenting changes in Hackney.</p>
<p>From 2002 onwards a handling collection was developed primarily consisting of a number of ‘suitcase’ resources. Each suitcase tells the story of somebody who moved to Hackney at some point in its history, through replica objects, copies of original photographs, alongside maps and other printed information. The suitcases, where possible, are created in collaboration with the represented person or a descendant, or are based on an oral history account in the Museum’s collection.</p>
<p>The handling collection also consists of other objects relating to specific eras that feature in our programme for schools, such as the Victorian era, World War II and Windrush, as well as objects from different communities that are represented in Hackney and are used extensively in the Museum’s Learning Programme.</p>

				     	<h2>Hampshire County Council</h2>
<p>The collection relates to the historic county of Hampshire as it was before the 1974 local government reorganisation when adjustments were made to the county boundary. In addition, some material has been acquired from further afield to facilitate greater public understanding of the Hampshire items by placing them in a broader context. This is particularly the case for the decorative arts, biology, geology and the social and industrial history collections.</p>
<p>The strengths of the current collections can be traced back to those of the three founding museums: Curtis Museum, Alton (founded in the 1850s); Red House Museum, Christchurch (1951) and the Willis Museum, Basingstoke (1931), which had all become the responsibility of Hampshire County Council by 1971.</p>
<p>The Curtis Museum can trace its collecting activities back to the 1850s, when rural and domestic ‘bygones&#8217; relating to the Alton area were acquired. A small collection of natural history curiosities collected by William Curtis in the 1840s dates back to the middle of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Local societies and individuals began to build up similar collections in Basingstoke and Christchurch from the 1920s onwards, prior to the establishment of the fledgling countywide service in 1962. The appointment of professional curators from the 1950s led to the development of systematic collecting policies for all of the major disciplines, including Decorative Art, Local and Industrial History, Archaeology and Natural Science.</p>
<p>The acquisition of a wide range of general agricultural machinery and iron goods manufactured by Taskers at their Anna Valley works near Andover from 1968 onwards stimulated the development of a major transport and technology collection. The scale and significance of this collection ultimately led to the opening in Basingstoke of Milestones – Hampshire&#8217;s living history museum in 2000.</p>
<p>Following the formation of the County Museums Service in 1974 other district councils in Hampshire entered into partnership with the County Council to establish local museums and encourage collecting in their districts. The expansion of this network of community museums has enabled professional museum staff to develop county and regional collections which aims to reflect the whole of Hampshire and its people.</p>
<h2>Winchester City Council</h2>
<p>Winchester City Museum is the oldest in Hampshire, founded privately in 1847 and transferred to the City Corporation in 1851 under the provisions of the newly established Museums Act. In accordance with the museum philosophy of the age, and their own taste and special interests, successive early curators acquired and disposed of material, moulding the content and extent of the collections in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Material from the whole of Hampshire, and indeed from further afield, was often collected, largely as a result of gifts from wealthy benefactors.</p>
<p>The appointment of a professional curator in 1947 led to the development of a more focused role as a repository for local history and archaeological material. This coincided with the start of systematic archaeological investigation both in the city and in the surrounding rural area. These two elements form the core of the collections today, the archaeological material being of national, and in some respects international, importance.</p>
<p>Following the establishment of the county-wide museums service in 1962, material from areas covered by the museums forming the service has not been collected. Since local government re-organisation in 1974, collecting has largely been restricted to the area within the boundaries of Winchester District. Photographic archives formerly held by the City Library were transferred to the City Museum at that time.</p>
<p>Some of the early material collected by Winchester City Museum has been relocated by gift or exchange to more appropriate museums: for example, in 2008, the geology collection was passed to Hampshire County Council Museums Service. Some objects have been retained because their presence in Winchester is published or well documented and are therefore more accessible for use if retained rather than relocated elsewhere. Others are retained because they have been given to the city by local people and are part of Winchester&#8217;s civic past.</p>
<h2>Management by Hampshire Cultural Trust</h2>
<p>In November 2014, the Hampshire Cultural Trust (HCT) was founded and signed agreements with both Hampshire County Council and Winchester City Council to manage the museum collections on their behalf. Ownership of the collections was retained by each council respectively.</p>
<p>HCT is an independent charity that provides the professional expertise and experience to develop the collections on behalf of the councils. Both councils are represented at Board level, and have approved a scheme of delegation with regards to the development of their collections that is reflected in this policy.</p>
<p>Initially, HCT employed subject-specialist curators to manage the collections thematically under the following headings: art, archaeology &amp; numismatics, natural history, social history and photographs. Each curator oversaw the development of their collections in line with a shared objective to enhance the relevance of the collections to Hampshire or Winchester respectively.</p>
<p>Since 2018, collections management has been integrated into a programme matrix, a function that operates across all work-streams combining collections management with exhibitions. With professional expertise at its core, the new structure represents the ambition to better use the collections for public benefit.</p>

				     	<h2>Hampshire County Council Collections</h2>
<h3>Hampshire Archaeology</h3>
<p>This collection is formed of the material evidence of human existence and industry in Hampshire from 500,000 years ago to the Second World War derived from major research excavations, rescue archaeology, field walking and stray finds. Hampshire County Council is designated through the planning process as the appropriate recipient body for archives from developer-led archaeological investigations in Hampshire. This collection includes a significant number of numismatic items and a small amount of material from historic collections of Ancient Egypt.</p>
<p>Significant archaeological sites included in this collection include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Danebury, and the Danebury Environs Project – nationally significant research excavations of now iconic Iron Age hillfort</li>
<li>Owslebury Iron Age and Roman rural settlement</li>
<li>Silchester (post-1974) – one of the best preserved Roman towns in Britain</li>
<li>Roman kiln sites of the New Forest and Woolmer Forest</li>
<li>Basing House (post 1978), Tudor home and site of Civil War battle</li>
<li>Odiham Castle, former home of King John and possibly the place from which he rode to Runnymede to sign the Magna Carta</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hampshire Art</h3>
<p>This collection represents the cultural life of Hampshire and its people from the medieval period to the present day. It embraces fine art, sculpture, ceramics, glass, metalwork, historic dress and textiles, horology, and firearms. Historically, the strengths of the art collections arises from the three founding collections and their subsequent development: Curtis Museum, Alton (historic dress and textiles, decorative arts, firearms) Red House Museum, Christchurch (historic dress and textiles, decorative art) and the Willis Museum, Basingstoke (horology, historic dress and textiles). This includes a ceramics collection, which is arguably of national significance. Today, relevance and association with the county of Hampshire is the overriding consideration for new acquisitions.</p>
<p>Significant elements within this collection include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outstanding ceramic collections including country pottery, delftware, art pottery, studio pottery and ceramic tiles, including a rare 1679 full height tin-glazed earthenware figurine of Ignis</li>
<li>Extensive historic textile and dress collections including an outstanding collection of agricultural smocks, Rivis collection of 18<sup>th </sup>&#8211; 20<sup>th</sup> century ladies&#8217; dresses and the only surviving garment with a good provenance to Jane Austen</li>
<li>The Vokes collection of historic sporting firearms including one sporting gun attributed to young Lord Byron</li>
<li>Paintings and drawings of local artists including a significant collection of works by William H Allen (1863 – 1943) and Martin Snape (1852-1930)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hampshire Natural Sciences</h3>
<p>The biology and geology collections represent Hampshire&#8217;s natural environment, past and present. The biology collections include specimens of preserved plants and animals collected over the last 150 years. Although modern collecting focusses on Hampshire, there are some specimens from abroad, including a well-preserved set of Dodo bones. The entomology collections are primarily a British collection, but with a strong Hampshire bias. They act as the repository for supporting evidence for Hampshire Biodiversity Information Centre records. The geology collections contain fossils specimens from the Cretaceous, Paleogene and Quaternary rocks from Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. There are also fossil specimens along with rocks and minerals from classic Victorian British and International sites.</p>
<p>Voucher and reference specimens, archives and reference works within this collection are fundamental to the aims and objectives of the Hampshire Biodiversity Information Centre, the Hampshire Geodiversity Community Network and support other environmental research, both locally and nationally.</p>
<p>Significant elements within this collection include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biological reference collection of approximately 135,000 specimens of preserved plants and animals, mainly collected from the British Isles with an emphasis on Hampshire. Most of the oldest specimens, with the earliest dated 1737, were collected by the Curtis Museum but many different collectors have contributed to the collection over the years.</li>
<li>The oldest skeletal remains come from two extinct birds, the Dodo (from Mauritius) and the Moa (from New Zealand). Both of these have local links with William Curtis.</li>
<li>A comprehensive geology collection of minerals, rocks and particularly fossil specimens from the Quaternary, Paleocene and Cretaceous periods of Hampshire and Isle of Wight.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hampshire Photographs</h3>
<p>The collection contains a large number of portraits and topographical views of the historic county of Hampshire and its people dating from the 1850s to the present day. Photographs are acquired primarily for their topographical or collections-related content rather than for any artistic merit although the two sometimes occur in the same image. The collection consists of photographic prints, negatives, glass plate negatives, lantern-slides and transparencies.</p>
<p>Significant elements within this collection include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photographs chronicling the Tichborne Trials, the extended 19<sup>th</sup> century legal battle that led to national legal reform</li>
<li>Comprehensive archive of images and postcards of Hampshire&#8217;s towns and villages</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hampshire Local History</h3>
<p>This collection consists of objects and information that tell the story of everyday life and work in Hampshire, mainly from the 19th century to modern times tracing the changing patterns as Hampshire moved from a rural to an urban economy. It includes maps, childhood collections and objects relating to local industries and transport heritage. A significant collecting area has been the impact of manufacturing within Hampshire with a particular focus on transport material relating to Taskers, Thornycroft, Wallis and Steevens, Lansing Bagnall and Gordon Keeble.</p>
<p>Significant elements within this collection include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transport collections including 1875-1926 Tasker steam engines, 1920-1950s Wallis and Steevens steam and motor road rollers, 1896-1960s Thornycroft cars and commercial vehicles</li>
<li>Domestic technology from 1890s to 1990s including the Trainor collection of iconic popular household design items from the 1950s and 1960s</li>
<li>Extensive childhood collection of toys of the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> century including an outstanding variety of teddy-bears and dolls</li>
</ul>
<h2>Winchester City Council Collections</h2>
<h3>Winchester Archaeology &amp; Numismatics</h3>
<p>The collection comprises material and records recovered as the result of research excavations, ‘rescue archaeology&#8217;, and now the planning process. Winchester City Council is designated as the appropriate recipient body for archaeological archives from developer-led archaeological investigations in the Winchester district area. From the city itself comes the largest urban archaeological collection arising from systematic excavation outside London, and as such is arguably of international significance. The collection includes a significant numismatic collection ranging from preRoman to post-medieval coins from the area including the largest collection of Winchester mint coins in Europe. In addition, the collection includes limited World Archaeology and World Cultures collections formed in the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<p>Among the many significant elements of this collections are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Historic and modern excavations within the city centre, such as the Brook Street sites, Wolvesey Palace and the cathedral, tracing nearly 2,000 years of urban development</li>
<li>Northern, eastern and western city Roman cemeteries with over 2,000 graves in total, including Osborne School (formerly Lankhills)</li>
<li>Hyde Abbey, in Winchester&#8217;s northern suburb, and St Mary&#8217;s Abbey in Abbey View Gardens</li>
<li>Anglo-Saxon cemeteries at Worthy Park, Winnall and Old Dairy Cottage site</li>
<li>Bronze Age burials and urns from Oliver&#8217;s Battery</li>
<li>Many Winchester rural parishes &#8211; including iron smelting in the Forest of Bere</li>
<li>Exceptional individual objects such as the Winchester Moot Horn, the Winchester Reliquary and examples of the Winchester Art style of the 10<sup>th</sup> century.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Winchester Local History &amp; Topographical Art</h3>
<p>This collection includes objects and fine art illustrating the character and development of the city and district from the post-medieval period to the present day. The fine art, similar to photography, is topographic in nature although some objects are of local or regional artistic value as well. Particular strengths of the existing collections are in material manufactured by local firms or craftspeople, objects relating to local retailers and industries, and material relating to civic and social history and institutions. This collection includes material given by civic groups such as visiting twin town representatives and the city&#8217;s weights and measures.</p>
<p>Significant elements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A range of everyday items sold or produced in the city and district in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> century chronicling a former way of life, including for example the stock of Foster&#8217;s tobacconist</li>
<li>Drawings and paintings of Winchester through the ages including a comprehensive collection of works by C B Phillips sketching the streets and buildings of the city</li>
<li>Items associated with prominent people associated with Winchester, for example the cyclist F D Frost, or the Marchioness of Winchester</li>
<li>Gifts to the city, not least the oil painting of &#8216;King Charles II&#8217; by Sir Peter Lely, dated 1680 and John Opie&#8217;s ‘Lady Elizabeth Woodville pleading for her children before Edward IV&#8217;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Winchester Photographs</h3>
<p>This is the largest collection of historical photographic material of Winchester and district. The collection consists mainly of photographs from 1870 to the present day, but also includes some cine film, and video and audio tape.</p>
<p>Significant elements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The complete set of Mayoral portraits from 1848 to the present day</li>
<li>The Hampshire Chronicle glass plate negative collection representing the 1950s to 1970s</li>
<li>The work of local photographers tracing modern development such as William Savage (late 19th century), W.T. Green (Edwardian period) and Heathcote Wride 1930s-1950s</li>

				     	<p>The Haynes Motor Museum is the product of the lifelong passion for all things motoring of one man; John Haynes OBE.</p>
<p>Following an initial foray into automotive publishing while still at school, John built the hugely successful Haynes Publishing Group, based at Sparkford in Somerset. An avid collector of cars and automobilia, he acquired a nearby former sawmills as a location to store and to exhibit his collection.</p>
<p>Opening in 1985 with an initial collection of 35 cars, the Museum now houses over 300 cars and other vehicles and includes a garage and restoration facility, a dedicated Education Centre, archive and conference and lecture facilities.</p>
<p>Attracting around 130,000 visitors a year, the Museum is now a UK Independent Charitable Trust, thus securing the collection in perpetuity.</p>

				     	<p>The collection comprises over 300 cars and other vehicles, plus a substantial supporting collection of automobilia including enamel signs and roadside furniture. The vehicle collection ranges from veteran and vintage to modern supercars. The bulk of the collection is housed in a number of themed galleries, with a small reserve collection in either on or off site storage. Restoration or repair work to collection vehicles is carried out in a specialised facility on site. A substantial archive and reference library is also housed on site.</p>
<p>The vehicle collection overwhelmingly consists of cars with a small number of other vehicles including a 1920s Albion lorry and a number of motorcycles. Of the cars, the earliest is an 1898 Daimler Wagonette, although the collection does include a working replica of an 1886 Benz Motorwagen. The collection has a true international emphasis, with most car producing countries represented. Loans in currently include 13 Williams F1 cars.</p>
<p>The supporting collection includes a number of children&#8217;s pedal cars by Triang, Bing and other manufacturers and ranging in date from the 1920s to the 1990s.</p>
<p>Toy and model cars include commercial models and a number of scratch built models of cars in the collection at 1/16 scale commissioned by John Haynes.</p>
<p>Chassis and cutaway engines include a cutaway electrically powered Daimler Dart chassis produced for the 1939 Earls Court motor show, a working model of a Barsanti and Mateucci engine and a variety of other engines and gearboxes, mostly sectioned for display.</p>
<p>The automobilia collection includes over 200 enamel advertising signs, petrol pumps and their associated globes and other examples of roadside furniture.</p>
<p>The Reference Library Collection comprises approximately 4,200 books and a further 54,000 magazines and pamphlets. These cover all aspects of motoring history and include commercially published books, technical and service manuals and runs of magazines such as &#8220;The Autocar&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Photographic Collection numbers approximately 12.000 images. Most are prints of commercial photographs relating to car sales and launches, although there is a substantial component relating to the Museum and its collection.</p>

				     	<h2>Founding collections</h2>
<p>Doncaster Museum opened in March 1910. The museum started with 1006 objects, which were owned by the Doncaster Microscopic and General Scientific Society. These collections included archaeology, natural history, geology, ethnography, arms, ceramics, prints, medals, &#8220;bygones&#8221; and coins.</p>
<p>Cusworth became the main repository for Social History when it opened in 1967. The first curator there, John Goodchild had a free rein to collect objects for the new museum, and collected archives and industrial history objects. Later curators focussed more on collecting country house and social history objects. Bernard Cuttriss had his own separate museum within Cusworth in the 1960s, mainly of Victorian social history and militaria and some of this material was amalgamated into the main collections.</p>
<h2>Significant Curators and donors</h2>
<p>EF Gilmour, director from 1952 to 1967 was a natural history specialist, with a particular interest in long horned beetles (Cerambycidae). Gilmour acquired a large number of Cerambycids for the collection, some of which are type specimens, and some of which have an uncertain provenance.</p>
<p>In 1964, Doncaster Museum moved into its present building on Chequer Road. As the museum was larger than the previous building, and Gilmour had plans to expand the collections to give them more of a &#8220;World View&#8221;, he acquired a large amount of natural sciences material from other museums which was at the time surplus to their requirements. These included Carlisle, Kilmarnock, Chelmsford and Scarborough Museums. Gilmour also acquired some material from the Imperial Institute, where he had worked in the 1940s. This material forms part of the World Cultures and Natural Sciences collections</p>
<p>In the 1950s and early 1960s, Doncaster Museum had a zoo containing up to 400 animals. Many of the animals found their way into the museum&#8217;s collections after they had died.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, Anne Hull Grundy donated around 600 pieces of jewellery, decorative art and art medals to Doncaster Museum.</p>
<p>Frank Brangwyn was a major donor to the art gallery, donating 66 pieces of his work in 1944. The Contemporary Art Society has gifted 72 works to the art gallery since 1952.</p>
<p>Don Bramley, a volunteer, collected around 300 geological specimens for the museum.</p>
<p>In 1974, the museum was given the E M Morehouse collection of Mollusca which consisted of around 5500 lots of shells.</p>
<p>The first archaeological objects were given to the museum by ex-Mayor, William Cotterill Clarke. His collection includes some of &#8216;s earliest and most important prehistoric artefacts. The archaeological/Antiquities collection was further augmented by the museum&#8217;s first curator Henry Corbett who appears to have collected together archaeological artefacts from collectors/donors around and adjoining the borough.</p>
<h2>Other key acquisitions</h2>
<p>After the First World War, the museum acquired a large number of &#8220;souvenirs&#8221; from the war, including helmets, swords and shells. A tank was given to the town after the war and stood outside the Beechfield Museum until 1938.</p>
<p>In the 1930s Professor C.E. Whiting of Durham University undertook excavations at Sutton Common Prehistoric Marsh Fort, Hampole Medieval Priory, Barnburgh Medieval Chapel and Stancil Roman Villa. Finds from these sites found their way into the collections at the museum.</p>
<p>In the 1950s-70s the archaeology collections were increased and excavations in Doncaster town centre produced large archives, relating to the Roman Fort and Vicus (Civil Settlement) and the Norman to pre Tudor Town. With the introduction of PPG16 (The Planning Policy Guidance for Development and Archaeology) in 1996 the museum saw an increase in professional archaeological archives, covering the whole borough.</p>
<p>The first work of art to enter the collection was Miss E.M Wilde&#8217;s painting, Low Tide, which the corporation purchased from the ‘Summer Exhibition of Modern Art&#8217; held at Beechfield in 1912. From that time the collection has gradually grown through a mixture of purchases, gifts and bequests.</p>
<p>Many objects in our collection have been bought with grant aid, including a number of racing cups from Doncaster Racecourse, 3 paintings by Joseph Wright, Giants Refreshed by Terence Cuneo and a large number of decorative art pieces.</p>
<h2>Key disposals</h2>
<p>In 1933, a large amount of natural history material was destroyed due to infestation.</p>
<p>Since 2003, the collection has undergone several rationalisation projects. This was due to the fact that past collecting, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s was very prolific, leaving a collection with many duplicate objects, objects which were not relevant to the Doncaster Borough and objects in poor condition. Staff restructures during this period left fewer specialist and curatorial staff to look after the collection adequately. Objects were disposed via donation to other museums and education services and community projects, destruction where material was in poor condition, and sale as a last resort.</p>
<p>In 2004, following the refurbishment of Cusworth Hall and move of the collection to an off-site store, around 1300 pieces of social history were disposed.</p>
<p>In 2008, around 2000 pieces of costume were disposed.</p>
<p>In 2012-14, Around 4000 objects were disposed as part of the Taking Stock Project.</p>
<p>In 2013 7000 palaeontological specimens were allocated for disposal to other museums as part of the CIRCA project.</p>

				     	<p>At present (2018) the following collections have a member of staff with expertise in that particular field</p>
<ul>
<li>Social and Local History</li>
<li>Archaeology (Including Antiquities)</li>
<li>World Cultures</li>
<li>Fine and Decorative Arts</li>
</ul>
<p>Other collections are not supported by in-house expertise. For these we would actively look to recruit volunteers or honorary curators with knowledge relevant to these collections. We would also look to apply for grants to take on a temporary staff member to facilitate the curation of these collections. We would also look at accessing external expertise and working in partnership with other organisations and individuals.</p>
<h2>Social History</h2>
<p>The Social History collections comprise around 35,000 items illustrating the themes of working, domestic, personal and community life from around 1700 to the present day, with particular reference to the geographical area now covered by the Doncaster Borough (hereafter referred to as the Doncaster area).

<ul>
<li>Mammals (mounted, skins, spirit-preserved, skeletal) 1620</li>
<li>Birds (mounted, skins, skeletal, eggs) 10,000</li>
<li>Herptiles (mounted and spirit preserved) 400</li>

<li>Spirit preserved athropods and other invertebrates 800 tubes</li>
<li>Botanical specimens, including algae, fungi and seed plants 6,000</li>
<li>The collection includes specimens from the Doncaster Zoo.</li>
</ul>
<p>British Mammals – a good representative collection of British species, including an extensive series of skins and associated skulls of some rodents (e.g. mice from coalmines). There is a modest collection of world species, including game heads. Of particular note is a hybrid Quagga foal, a unique mount dating from 1830 by Doncaster taxidermist Hugh Reid.</p>
<p>Birds and birds&#8217; eggs – a fairly representative world collection, but especially British specimens. Sources from which these have been acquired include local country houses, named skin collectors and modern casualties. The birds&#8217; egg collection is largely from local collectors.</p>
<h3>Herptiles</h3>
<p>There is a modest collection of world species, including specimens from the old Doncaster Zoo.</p>
<p>Fish – There is a modest collection of fish, which is of wide geographical provenance, although mostly British. The historic taxidermy includes include two Yorkshire Sturgeons and a non-local Tench by J. Cooper &amp; Sons of Hounslow.</p>
<h3>Mollusca</h3>
<p>There are two main collections of molluscs, the collection of J.A. Hargreaves (British species, at least half from ) and the collection of E.M. Morehouse (world species). The strength of the mollusc collection lies in freshwater and land specimens.</p>
<h3>Entomology</h3>
<p>The Lepidoptera collections are mainly of British species. There are also some foreign specimens. Most families are represented in the world Coleoptera collection, which contains the Cerambycidae collection of E.F. Gilmour, including type and figured specimens. The Diptera collection is particularly strong in material from Yorkshire, North Wales and the Scottish Highlands. There are also some exotic Diptera. There is a regionally important collection of British Hymenoptera species, also some foreign specimens. Heritage Doncaster has an important collection of Palaeoentomological specimens, particularly from the Humberhead Levels.</p>
<h3>Spirit-preserved anthropods</h3>
<p>Heritage Doncaster has spirit-preserved British species of insects in their immature stages, ectoparasites (external parasites), Arachnida (spiders etc), Malacostraca (e.g. woodlice), Diplopoda (millipedes), Chilopoda (centipedes) etc.</p>
<h3>Botany</h3>
<p>The Botany collection comprises a small collection of 19<sup>th</sup> century, unlocalised seaweeds and a collection of lichens of national scope, Bryophytes, Peridophytes and seed plants. The collection includes a large British collection comprising the H. &amp; J.H. Payne herbarium which is of British scope with a Yorkshire emphasis, the H.H. Corbett herbarium of mainly Doncaster material and also recently-collected material, especially from staff collecting for the Doncaster Plant Recording Project – now the Doncaster Botanical Atlas Project.</p>
<h3>Environmental Records</h3>
<p>Heritage Doncaster has maintained species-based card indexes of all recorded groups of flora and fauna (except birds) since 1963. However these are regarded as a research resource rather than as an accessioned part of the museum collections.</p>
<p>The collections therefore consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original notebooks and papers of local and regional naturalists, including staff notebooks and natural history societies</li>
<li>Annotated floras</li>
<li>Local estates and hunting archives relating to property in the area</li>
</ul>
<h3>Strengths</h3>
<ul>
<li>British birds and eggs</li>
<li>Local taxidermy</li>
<li>Mounted specimens</li>
<li>Cerambycidae collection</li>
<li>Diptera collection</li>
<li>Hyde Collection</li>
</ul>
<h2>Geology and Palaeontology</h2>
<h3>Current collections</h3>
<p>The geology collections are made up of three parts: palaeontology; mineralogy; petrology.</p>
<p>Palaeontology – The palaeontology collection currently consists of an estimated 3,000+ individual items, mainly from the UK but includes some foreign specimens. The strengths of the collection are based around Carboniferous plant remains, primarily deriving from local deposits across the Doncaster area. The Jurassic Period is well illustrated with many specimens deriving from the Yorkshire coast and beyond.</p>
<p>Mineralogy – The mineralogy collections are currently made up of two distinctly stored collections: the comprehensive, chemically arranged mineralogy collection; the more recent precious and semi-precious gems.</p>
<p>Petrology – The petrology (rock) collections are in three parts: igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic petrology. The igneous and metamorphic are discrete collections.</p>
<h3>Strengths of collection</h3>
<p>Perceived strengths of the collection are largely around regional Carboniferous and material. However locally within the borough the Carboniferous collections are not as comprehensive as would be expected.</p>
<p>Some of the more important specimens include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A near complete ichthyosaur from Dorset</li>
<li>A collection of 23 eurypterids from Scotland</li>
<li>A dinosaur egg from France</li>
<li>Bisat and Culpin collections</li>
<li>Shark egg case</li>
</ul>

				     	<p>Frederick Horniman, tea merchant, politician and philanthropist, was a compulsive and passionate collector, fascinated by the power of real objects. He used his own travels and a network of agents to amass a huge collection of specimens from every corner of the world which he then made freely available to the people. These collections, well-curated and developed over the past 150 years have enabled the Horniman to become one of the few museums in the country capable of illustrating the breadth of the World&#8217;s natural and cultural diversity.</p>
<p>As with any collections of this nature, our collection includes objects that are today subject to restrictions that did not exist at the time of collection, including those made of controlled materials (i.e. ivory), human remains, and cultural property which we now understand it is disrespectful for us to own, store or display.</p>
<p>As the Horniman begins to confront its colonial history we wish to develop an ethical approach to collections development which will take into account the views of source and diaspora communities and past history of collecting.</p>

<h2>Description of existing Ethnographic and Archaeology collections</h2>
<h3>Quality and variety of collection</h3>
<p>The Anthropology collections of the Horniman Museum, which are estimated to number in excess of 100,000 objects, are among the most significant anthropology collections in the United Kingdom. They comprise objects from many regions of the world and include specimens of major national and international significance.</p>
<p>The core of the Oceanian collections was systematically assembled under the auspices of A. C. Haddon, an eminent Oceanist who acted as Advisory Curator between 1903 and 1915. It contains material from the three sub-areas of the Pacific, namely Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia, as well as Australia, with a particularly strong focus on Papua New Guinea. Numbering almost 7,000 artefacts, it is distinguished by its particularly fine quality objects and important source collections from which many of them were derived. Notable among these is a group of 32 artefacts formerly belonging to James Edge Partington (1913), Fijian material from Sir Everard Im Thurn (1918–20), J. K. Hutchin&#8217;s Rorotonga collection (1903) and Papuan collections made by W. H. Abbot from Collingwood Bay (1903), C. G. Seligman and Cooke Daniel (1906), A.C. Haddon (1906, 1912) and later L. P. Robbins (made in the 1890s, but purchased in 1932), and Lord Moyne (1936).</p>
<p>Many of the objects within the Asian collection were acquired through purchase by Frederick or John Emslie Horniman from international exhibitions such as the Great Exhibition (1851), the India and Colonial Exhibition (1886), the Vienna Exhibition (1889) and the Anglo-Japanese Exhibition (1910). Others were purchased in the course of world travels (India and Sri Lanka (1894); USA, Japan, China, Burma and southern India (1895)), while still others came through dealers and auction houses and through the assistance of agents and acquaintances (the Rev Robert Davidson, western China (1895); Sir Somers Vine, India (various dates)). The collections have been further increased in the 20th century through systematic field collecting carried out by curators and other anthropologists. Notable among these are the Andaman collections made by Montague Protheroe (1908) and A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, one of the founders of modern anthropology (1910), Maldive collections made by Stanley Gardiner, Charles Hose&#8217;s spectacular collection from Borneo and Sir Henry Cotton&#8217;s and Maj-Gen K.J. Kiernan&#8217;s (1969) Naga collections from Assam (1916 and 1969 respectively). Important curatorial collections include Otto Samson&#8217;s extensive field collections from India, Sikkim and Tibet (1936–7), Ken Teague&#8217;s collections from Central Asia (1991–2001) and Fiona Kerlogue&#8217;s collections from Japan and South-East Asia (2001–9). Other important material has been donated, such as the Mears collection of Chinese Qing dynasty material. In recent years the Museum has also purchased good material from anthropologists such as Genevieve Duggan&#8217;s field collection of textiles from Savu, Indonesia; Willemijn de Jong&#8217;s field collection from Flores, also in Indonesia; and Susan Conway&#8217;s fieldwork collection of Thai textiles.</p>
<p>Amongst the most important of our collections from Europe are the Lovett collection, chiefly of English ‘folklore&#8217; material acquired between 1906 and 1933; material from Mary Edith Durham from Montenegro (1907) and Albania (1920); an extensive collection of material covering all aspects of rural life in Romania presented to the Museum by the Romanian government in 1957; a collection of propaganda posters from the former Soviet Union collected by Chris Tsielepi; and the Pennington collection of costume from the former Yugoslavia acquired in 1981.</p>
<p>The African collection contains a considerable variety of material and represent aspects of many different lifestyles (hunter-gatherers, pastoralists, agriculturists and indigenous politics as well as contemporary urban life), stretching from the northern deserts to the Cape of Good Hope, and from the Guinea Coast to the Horn of Africa. Many of the collections are associated with eminent names in African studies, including early anthropologists and scholars such as: Emile Torday, Zaire (1910); Edward Evans-Pritchard, Sudan (1920–30); Siegfried Nadel, Nigeria (1930s); Daryl Forde, Nigeria (1980s); as well as from colonial officers, missionaries and private collectors: F. H. Ruxton, Nigeria (1930s); Graham, Sierra Leone (1950s), Leroux, Zaire (1968), the Rev Lionel West, Zaire (1970); W. Holman Bentley, Congo (1905); Jean Jenkins and P. Radford, Ethiopia (1960s–70s). The African collection has continued to grow over the last half-century and includes important additions made under the directorship of Otto Samson (1947–65) and later David Boston (1965–93), as well as through the work of Horniman curators such as Valerie Vowles and Keith Nicklin.</p>
<p>The American collection was built from donations, particularly the Inuit and Northwest Coast collections made by A. C. Haddon, and the E. Lovett North</p>
<p>American Collection which was presented to the Museum by Emslie Horniman. Emslie himself made important donations of North American material to the Museum, including pre-Columbian archaeological pieces from central Mexico and Oaxaca. John Eric Horniman, Emslie&#8217;s son, also made an excellent collection of Plains Indian beaded material, including clothing, pipe bags and a bonnet. In 1961 the Museum acquired a Blackfoot Tipi, transferred from the Glenbow Museum, Canada. The Museum has also sponsored contemporary North American Indian artists. In 1966, Fred Stevens, a Navajo medicine man, executed a sand painting in the Museum; while in 1985 Nathan Jackson, of the Tlingit people of Alaska, carved a 25-ft totem pole and presented it to the Museum.</p>
<p>The ethnographic collections also include the former collection of the National Museum of Wales, transferred in 1981, as well as transfers from: the Smithsonian Institute; the Glenbow Museum; the Royal Museum of Canterbury, which includes an important 18th-century drill bow from Northern Alaska collected by Captain James Cook in 1778 or 1779; and the Museum of the American Indian, New York. The Museum also holds objects on loan from the Royal Collections.</p>
<p>The collections also include important archaeological specimens, including several Egyptian mummies and related funerary furnishings acquired through Sir Flinders Petrie, lithographic collections from various parts of Africa, various smaller pieces of Gandhara stone sculpture, pre-Columbian Caribbean stone tools and implements, pre-Columbian Mexican and Peruvian ceramics and some European archaeology.</p>
<p>A substantial part of this collection was part of the original gift of Frederick Horniman, although later additions were made by, for example, A. C. Haddon, as well as a large collection from the Canary Islands, transferred to the Horniman from the Institute of Archaeology in 1972 and collected by F. E. Zeuner. The early collections are of particular importance as they shed light on &#8216;the beginnings of archaeology&#8217;.</p>
<p>As with most of the major ethnographic collections in the UK, no general survey of this collection has been published. Dr Ken Teague has written on the early period of the collection and two manuscripts, in the Horniman Museum Archive, chart their overall historical growth. Specific historical aspects of the collection have been discussed by Annie Coombes and Anthony Shelton. A summary statistical survey has been published by the Museum Ethnographers Group, while the Oceanic collections are reported in the 1979 UNESCO survey. The mask collections have been extensively reported and surveyed in Anthony Shelton&#8217;s <em>Masks</em>, the footwear collections are documented in Natalie Tobert&#8217;s <em>Feet of ingenuity, </em>and the headwear in Pitt and Norris&#8217;s <em>Catalogue of headwear</em>. Other parts of the collection have been described in various published guides to exhibitions and in academic monographs and journals. In the catalogue <em>Wrapping Japan</em>, for example, Fiona Kerlogue gives an overview of our Japanese collections, and her article ‘Theoretical perspectives and scholarly networks: the development of the collections from the Malay world at the Horniman Museum 1898 –2008&#8242; provides an extensive examination of the Museum&#8217;s Malaysian collections. The Museum&#8217;s own series <em>Contributions in Critical Museology and Material Culture</em> has also included articles on different aspects of the collections. The two volumes on <em>Collectors</em> edited by Anthony Shelton, Nicky Levell&#8217;s <em>Oriental visions</em>, and <em>Re-visions</em> edited by Karel Arnaut, cover different aspects of the collections.</p>
<h3>Demonstrable quality, uniqueness or rarity</h3>
<h4>Oceania</h4>
<p>Within the Pacific collection there are notable holdings from the Bismarck Archipelago, two chalk figures and five <em>tatuana</em> masks from New Ireland, extensive Papuan Gulf material including <em>gope</em> boards, personal decoration, etc. The collection contains two Solomon Island canoes, three particularly fine anthropomorphic prow ornaments, a Cook Island canoe and models and canoe attachments from elsewhere in the Pacific. There are also two important and rare dance paddles from the Easter Islands and a rare whisk handle from the Astral Islands.</p>
<p>The collection is continuously being improved and boasts notable acquisitions such as a collection of Baining masks from the 1950s and 1970s used in night ceremonies and a well-documented field collection, including video footage and photographic documentation, of 13 <em>uvol</em> headdresses from the Melkoy people. This is one of only two of its type in the UK and forms part of the original van Bussal collection shared between the Museum of African and Oceanic Art, Paris; Museum für Völkerkunde, Stuttgart; and the Royal Albert Museum, Exeter. Other acquisitions include two contemporary dance headdresses from the Torres Strait, Australia, acquired to compliment two fine 19th century examples in tortoiseshell held by the Museum.</p>
<h4>Asia</h4>
<p>The Asian collections account for about 42% of the total holdings, or approximately 41,023, items and are particularly rich in art, masks and puppets, and material culture from India, China, Japan (including objects from the Ainu), Sri Lanka and Burma. Many of the Indian and Japanese holdings formed part of Horniman&#8217;s original collection and include important examples of stone sculpture, ritual objects and Japanese, Chinese and Indian costumes.</p>
<p>The Mary Burkett collection of felt from the Middle East, acquired in the 1980s, is regarded as the reference collection for such material in the UK. Rare individual items include a Brunei <em>gantang</em> or rice measure, believed to be the only one in a UK collection; a pair of enormous cloisonné vases; a summer palanquin and a <em>bamen</em>, or horse mask from Japan; rare documents relating to secret societies in China; a mask and funerary post from the Jorai people of Vietnam; a bearskin war coat from Borneo; and so on.</p>
<h4>Africa</h4>
<p>The African collections, numbering an estimated 18,486 objects, represent 19% of the total ethnographic holdings. The geographical range of the collection is extensive, covering the whole of the continent, with virtually every modern African state represented. The collections boast several important pieces include two <em>Afo</em> figures donated by Ruxton, <em>Nkisi Nkondi</em> figures, an Ibibio figure with suspended sword, and several groups of African masks. Consequently, several of our important pieces have been included in major exhibitions both locally and internationally in institutions such as the Royal Academy of Arts, the British Museum, the Smithsonian Institution and the Museum of Word Cultures in Göteborg, Sweden.</p>
<h4>Americas</h4>
<p>The American collection contains about 8,500 objects, including artefacts from North America, Latin America and the Caribbean. It holds exceptional pieces, like the Inuit bucket decorated with bone figures, and three Inuit masks. Also included in this collection are 59 Northwest Coast pieces transferred from the Museum of the American Indian, New York (1934), which include fine examples of Haida material; two Kwatiutl masks and related material transferred from the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew (1958); as well as field collections and purchases such as a collection of Inuit seal skin clothing from the Church Missionary Society (1965).</p>
<h4>Europe</h4>
<p>A unique aspect of the collection is that it contains substantial and important folk art collections from western and central Europe as well as Scandinavia. Until recently, the Horniman has been the only museum in the UK committed to research in this area. Notable among these collections are extensive holdings of textiles, costume, wooden utensils, paintings on glass, agricultural and domestic implements, puppet theatres and masks from Romania, Poland, Norway and the Tyrol region. In the opinion of Deborah Swallow, Director of the Courtauld Institute and former Keeper of Indian Collections at the V&amp;A, ‘the Horniman certainly has the widest range of early 20th century European folk costume in this country and possibly in Europe as a whole&#8217;.</p>
<p>The Museum&#8217;s European collections include rare items from Scandinavia such as calendar staffs, ceremonial drinking cups and mangle boards. Archaeological material includes some of the earliest evidence of human activity in England as well as Danish material from the collection of the first Lord Avebury. Other individual items include a coracle from Ireland, a set of penitents&#8217; costumes from Spain, and carnival masks from Sardinia.</p>
<h3>Aesthetic significance</h3>
<p>Although from 1901 the Horniman has focused much of its collecting policy on material culture, the collections nevertheless also contain objects of outstanding aesthetic significance. Material of this nature arrived under the directorship of Otto Samson (1947–1965), formerly a curator of the Museum für Völkerkunde, Hamburg, who had a special interest in art. Samson used his extensive continental connections to make collections of Yoruba <em>gelede</em> masks from the Republic of Benin and built an extraordinary collection of masks from the Pende, Yaka, Suka, Kuba and Congo peoples of Zaire.</p>
<p>The African collection contains important historical and archaeological collections, including extensive Egyptian burial material, some superb examples of 19th-century high status Aymara metalwork and primitivist paintings from Ethiopia, and Benin brasses and ivories, purchased from W. J. Wider of the British Punitive Expedition of 1897.</p>
<p>Objects of outstanding aesthetic significance may also be found in other regional areas of the collections. For example, many of Frederick Horniman&#8217;s early purchases of statuary and other religious artefacts from Asia are aesthetically strong, especially examples from Japan and India. Some of the Chinese archaeological ceramics are of fine quality. There are also a small number of 20th-century paintings from Bali, India and Mongolia.</p>
<p>Items of aesthetic significance in the European collections fall chiefly into the category of naïve art, such as scrimshaw, icons and wooden carvings. There are also examples of sculpture and ceramic art from the Greek and Roman period as well as mediaeval alabaster religious sculpture.</p>
<h3>Cultural significance</h3>
<p>Since the 1950s, the Museum has focused on building ethnographic archives representing the material culture of people from all parts of the world. These collections are the product of in-depth field research and provide extensive documentation of the cultures concerned, of technologies used and of the structure of human society in different ecological zones. Outstanding among these unique resources which provide type specimens of material culture at specific historical times are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Colin Turnbull</strong>, the Mbuti people of Zaire (1956–9);</li>
<li><strong>James Woodburn</strong>), the Hadza of Tanzania (1966;</li>

<h2>Description of existing Musical Instruments collection</h2>
<h3>Quality and variety of collection</h3>
<p>The Horniman Museum aims to include sound-producing objects from all periods of history, from all parts of the world, and from all musical traditions in the Musical Instrument collection. It is currently responsible for some 9703 examples, which are used extensively by all sectors of the public, including specialist scholars and musical instrument makers. While the MGC report <em>Museums of music</em> was inconclusive as to which museum had the largest collection in the country, the authors acknowledged that the Horniman ‘has some claims to being more comprehensive than any other in the UK&#8217;. The Museum&#8217;s instruments feature in numerous works of reference.</p>
<p>In 1901, Frederick Horniman&#8217;s gift to the public included some 200 musical instruments. Until the 1950s, the Museum&#8217;s Ethnography Section was responsible for the Musical Instrument collections. The quality and variety of the instruments acquired during that period reflect the ethnography holdings, since they were obtained from the same sources. Collections of objects for both the Anthropology and Musical Instrument sections, such as the systematic ethnographic material culture archive of the Bedamuni of the Western Province of Papua New Guinea (van Beek, 1978–9), and the musical instruments, costumes, masks and video performance of Chhau dance from Orissa and Bihar, provide tangible evidence of the continuing policy of documenting connections between the instruments and their cultural contexts. This policy is carried through into exhibitions curated by staff, as seen in temporary exhibitions such as <em>Music from India</em> and the permanent exhibition in the Music Gallery, where short extracts of video footage, from longer films documenting performance technique and contexts, are an integral part of the exhibition. The Boosey &amp; Hawkes display includes a range of material from the archives that contextualises instrument use and consumption. Instrument makers&#8217; tools and footage of instrument makers at work are also included. The At Home With Music display, opened in 2014, includes silent footage showing both exterior and interior views of the types of instruments on display and close-ups of the actions or working parts. In addition, it includes four accessioned historical keyboard instruments maintained in playing order and used on a regular basis for public performances.</p>
<p>In 1947 the status of the musical instrument collection was consolidated by the acquisition of the Carse Collection of over 300 historic woodwind and brass instruments from the European orchestral and band tradition. The collections of Percy Bull were added the following year, and in 1956, the transfer was made of a large part of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum&#8217;s collections of instruments from countries outside Europe. Jean Jenkins, the well-known ethnomusicologist and broadcaster, was appointed to the post of Curatorial Assistant in the early 1950s and became the first Keeper of Musical Instruments when the musical collections were formed into a separate department in 1960. Under her guidance, the ethno-musicological collections were developed both by fieldwork and by further transfers of substantial collections of instruments from other museums. Since 1978, the Musical Instrument Section has instigated the acquisition of a number of important collections, including the Dolmetsch collection; the collection of the Concertina Museum in Belper, Derbyshire (Wayne collection); the Boosey &amp; Hawkes collection; and the collections of instruments and recordings from rural India acquired in collaboration with the British Library Sound Archive between 2000 and 2005.</p>
<p>The range and types of the instruments represented in the collections is indicated below. The Museum&#8217;s instrument collection is particularly rich in historic European wind and brass wind instruments from the Carse and Bull collections.</p>
<p>The Boosey &amp; Hawkes collection includes over 300 historical musical instruments, mostly woodwind and brass, including those made by Boosey &amp; Hawkes and their subsidiaries and predecessors. It also features many instruments by other makers that illustrate important English and continental developments in design and manufacture. The Boosey &amp; Hawkes Collection was begun in the late 19th century by David James Blaikley, a pioneer of brass instrument design and the works manager of Boosey &amp; Co until 1930. Blaikley collected a wide range of historical and contemporary instruments from around Europe, many of which were examples of the latest developments in instrument design and technology. Boosey&#8217;s instrument makers clearly used the collection as an in-house design resource. The collection continued to grow in the 20th century, particularly during the curatorship of Eric McGavin. It is unique in that it reflects what was of historic interest and value to instrument makers and designers and is a rare survival of an instrument making firm&#8217;s factory collection. The collection also reflects the corporate history of Boosey &amp; Hawkes and their great influence on instrumental music in Britain. This aspect of the collection has become even more significant with the closure of the instrument making arm of Boosey &amp; Hawkes in December 2005, which marked the end of large-scale musical instrument making in Britain.</p>
<p>The Wayne collection of over 600 examples of concertinas and related European free reed instruments such as accordions and harmoniums represents a chronicle of the concertina, from its invention by Charles Wheatstone in 1829, with the earliest models and prototypes, through to its late 20th-century revival. It is complemented by a large collection of Asian free reed instruments from which the European instruments derive, including an elaborately gilded Japanese <em>sho</em> or mouth-organ, made for the orchestra of a named 18th-century Japanese nobleman. Single and double reed instruments include shawms from Africa and Asia, and the collection of bagpipes from Europe ranges from French instruments of the 18th century to a late 20th-century Polish example. Wind instrument collections made in Romania in 1867, 1957 and in the 1980s are among the most numerous of the Museum&#8217;s holdings in East European traditional instruments.</p>
<p>Among the stringed instruments, there are many varied examples of late 19th- and early 20th-century Indian long-necked lutes. Lyres from East and Central Africa are one of the strengths of the collections, as are zithers from many parts of the world. The bowed instruments are similarly representative of the world&#8217;s traditions; historic European examples include a number of kits and viols with some important English examples in the Dolmetsch collection. The 30 stringed keyboard instruments range from 17th-century Italian virginals to 20th-century player pianos, including later instruments of the early music revival by Arnold Dolmetsch. Among the collection of organs is a composite instrument with a rank of 17th-century Iberian pipes, a bureau organ attributed to the great London 18th-century maker of Swiss origin, John (Johannes) Snetzler, and a fine example (in playing order) of a late 18<sup>th</sup>-century English chamber organ attributed to Joseph Beloudy. The mechanical musical instruments include late 18th-century barrel organs, musical boxes, instruments reproducing recorded sound and an orchestrion (a large barrel organ) probably made for a German roller-skating rink, which once stood in the main hall of Frederick Horniman&#8217;s private museum, greeting visitors with favourites such as the overture to Hérold&#8217;s <em>Zampa</em> (1831). Electro-acoustic guitars and electronic synthesisers also feature in the collection and are part of a considered policy of collecting musical instruments from popular music traditions.</p>
<p>The Museum houses a large number of drums used in dance and ritual, from all parts of the world. Many have associated documentary evidence or video footage of how they were used. Bells and rattles include archaeological material from Roman Britain, Egypt, China, Luristan, and Peru; instruments used in religious rituals and dances in Africa, Asia and the Americas; and horse bells and other animal bells from the UK, Europe, Asia and Africa. South-East Asian gamelan orchestras of percussion instruments with bronze keys are played in both Java and Bali, and examples have been collected by a number of music colleges and museums in the UK. The Horniman Museum houses a village <em>gamelan ringgeng</em>, with iron keys, the only example of this vernacular version of the gamelan ensemble in the UK.</p>
<p>The Horniman houses over 75 examples of an instrument found in many of the musical cultures of sub-Saharan Africa, the plucked lamellaphone <em>mbira</em>. This instrument is rapidly disappearing in Africa, and many of the Museum&#8217;s examples are now no longer made. An example of a <em>mbira dza vadzimu</em> is the subject of a focused collection on the technology of making this instrument.</p>
<p>This year, the Horniman&#8217;s double manual Jacob Kirckman harpsichord of 1772 has been joined by three other contrasting historic keyboard instruments that have also been restored to playing condition and are used principally for performance-demonstrations in the Music Gallery. They are virginals by Onofrio Guarracino of Naples made in 1668, a square piano by Adam Beyer, made in London in 1777 and a chamber organ attributed to Joseph Beloudy of London, made circa 1800. They were purchased by the Horniman from the Finchcocks collection, with generous sponsorship from the National Lottery Heritage Fund.</p>
<h3>Demonstrable quality, uniqueness or rarity</h3>
<p>The Adam Carse Collection of over 300 woodwind and brass instruments from the Western orchestral and band traditions contains many outstanding items including:</p>
<ul>
<li>a horn by William Bull of London, made in 1699 and the earliest dated example of this instrument made in England;</li>
<li>a pair of flutes by Thomas Lot of Paris, complete with its shagreen-covered and silk-velvet lined case, which may have been made for a member of the French Royal family in the 18th century;</li>
<li>a group of recorders, flutes and oboes by Thomas Stanesby and Thomas Stanesby Jr who were among the most highly-regarded makers of woodwind in</li>
<li>London during the early 18th century (the oboes are particularly rare);</li>
<li>an important experimental model of bassoon by Schott of Mainz, incorporating a prototype version of Almanräder&#8217;s keywork;</li>
<li>a tenor saxhorn by Adolph Sax inscribed ‘La Famille Distin&#8217; and ‘T. Distin, London&#8217; (this instrument may have been presented to the Distins on their 1844 visit to Sax in Paris; Saxhorns, through the agency of Distin, became the mainstay of the British brass band);</li>
<li>Carse&#8217;s library, which includes 19th-century books not held by the British Library or the Bodleian Library;</li>
<li>Carse&#8217;s archive, which includes rare ephemera from the 18th and 19th centuries.</li>
</ul>
<p>A collection of more than 300 instruments from oriental art traditions as well as a number of folk traditions, built up in the 19th century, was transferred from the V&amp;A in 1956. This collection includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>an outstanding group of classical instruments made, possibly for the Persian court, in Shiraz during the 18th and early 19th centuries, including the earliest extant Persian <em>kamanche</em> (spike fiddle) which dates from <em>c.</em>1800, and was collected by Sir William Ousely, British ambassador to Persia – an instrument which should be brought to the attention of the authors of a recent scholarly study who state ‘… that … to our knowledge, no Persian musical instruments currently exist that belong to a period prior to 1850&#8242;;</li>
<li>a large group of Romanian, Turkish and Georgian instruments bought at the Paris Exhibition of 1867</li>
<li>a large group of 19th-century African instruments including a Zande harp described as ‘un chef-d&#8217;oeuvre de la lutherie zandé du début du XIXe siècle&#8217;.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Victoria and Albert Museum transfer also includes unique examples of Western instruments, such as the late 18th century monochord by Longman and Broderip of London. The makers claimed that this instrument facilitated tuning by amateurs in all kinds of keyboard instruments, and it is the subject of an entire article in volume 52 of the <em>Galpin Society Journal</em>.</p>
<p>The report by Kate Arnold-Foster and Hélène La Rue identifies some of the areas where the Horniman Museum has the only public collection in Britain of a particular group of instruments. These, and other notable examples, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>popular music:
<ul>
<li>a collection of popular instruments including electric guitars and guitar synthesisers from 1937 to the present;</li>
<li>a collection of popular keyboard instruments including electronic instruments from the 1950s to the present;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the Wayne collection of over 600 concertinas and other European free-reeds including the 19th-century ledgers of the C. Wheatstone &amp; Co concertina factory; described as a ‘spectacular collection of instruments&#8217;, this acquisition answers the lack of a public collection demonstrating the work of Wheatstone.</li>
</ul>
<p>The collection includes many individual instruments of outstanding quality and interest. For example, the German baroque lute by J. C. Hoffmann of Leipzig is the only known example of a Bach-period lute in original condition. The Friends of the Horniman have sponsored the Museum in commissioning a technical drawing of this instrument and as a result a number of working copies of it now exist.</p>
<p>Dolmetsch&#8217;s first harpsichord, known as the Green Harpsichord (M72-1983), signifies the initiation of the modern revival of interest in building early keyboard instruments within the authentic performance movement, the ramifications of which continue to the present day.</p>
<h3>Collections of comparable significance</h3>
<p>In terms of its overall collection size and quality the Horniman Museum should be rated with major American and European collections such as the Metropolitan Museum and the Brussels Musical Instrument Museum. The Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford, is of a similar rank and scope in terms of its ethnographic musical instrument material, but it has nothing comparable to the historic wind instruments of the Carse and Boosey &amp; Hawkes collections, the historic stringed instruments and instruments of the early music revival in the Dolmetsch collection, nor does it have the comprehensive range of European free reed instruments represented in the Horniman&#8217;s Wayne collection. The Bate Collection, Oxford, is similar in scope to the Carse collection in its focus on European wind instruments, but its holdings are not as extensive. The only other collection of similar scope in the UK is that at the British Museum, which is only about a third of the size.</p>
<h3>Aesthetic significance</h3>
<p>The internationally important collections of the Horniman Museum are a resource which has been utilised by authors over many decades to illustrate the aesthetic significance of musical instruments in Britain, Europe and throughout the world. In addition, certain significant and rare objects, such as the <em>violone</em> attributed to Maggini, have been used as models by modern instrument makers, not only to replicate but also to inform and elucidate their craft in general. In the major travelling exhibition <em>Eighteenth century musical instruments: France and Britain</em> a selection of the English instruments in the collection of the Museum, such as the double manual harpsichord by Jacob Kirckman, London, 1772, and the Broadwood square piano of 1799 were used to illustrate ‘the English … preference for the sobriety and elegance of line and … a remarkable concern for perfection of craftsmanship&#8217;. Such accessible research initiated a recognition and appreciation, hitherto lacking, of 18th- and early 19th-century keyboard manufacture in England – and influenced the course of scholarship in the decades that followed.</p>
<p>Of all the surviving examples of the fife and drum (<em>galoubet-tambourin</em>), it is a <em>tambourin</em> drum at the Horniman Museum dating from the time of Louis XVI that the authors of a recent publication consider to be the most important, on account of the quality of its carving, its ‘equilibrium and sobriety&#8217;.</p>
<p>A five-stringed sitar (1970.429) dating from <em>c.</em>1855 and originally in the collection of the India Muse um was loaned for an exhibition of music at the Mughal courts of India, staged in the Museé de la Musique in Paris in 2003. It is illustrated in the exhibition catalogue and described as ‘A beautiful example of the excellence of the artisanal skills of Dhaka&#8217;. Also shown in this exhibition and its exhibition catalogue is a 19th-century Turkish frame drum (HML 24.8.56/96), to illustrate a type known to have been used in the Mughal courts of the 17th century.</p>
<p>In his copiously illustrated survey of the Chinese spike fiddle <em>huqin</em>, Colin Huehns makes the following observation with regard to an example of this instrument (1975.510) in the collection of the Horniman Museum: ‘The level and complexity of the ornamentation in this instrument far exceeds that on any other Chinese instrument of any sort that I have ever encountered&#8217;.</p>
<p>Since the primary function of the majority of musical instruments lies in the sensory domain of sound rather sight, the Museum&#8217;s examples are frequently used to convey information about the aesthetics of music. Horniman instruments were used in the display that was ‘designed to show the instruments which Handel employed in his orchestra throughout his life in England&#8217; in the major exhibition illustrating the life and times of that composer, which was held in the National Portrait Gallery in 1983.</p>
<p>In 2006 a harp-lute by Edward Light, London, <em>c.</em>1810, with a painted floral border, was loaned to Taplow Court, once a home to members of the English aristocracy. This instrument (MT537-1998) was shown in an exhibition entitled <em>Taplow Court and Music</em>.</p>
<h3>Historic significance</h3>
<p>The musical instrument collection is associated with some important historical figures. These are listed here.</p>
<p>The collection of instruments owned and made by Arnold Dolmetsch (1858–1940) was purchased by the Museum in the early 1980s. The value of his work to the nation is chronicled in the <em>Dictionary of National Biography</em>. His collection includes material which documents the links between the revival of early music and the Arts and Crafts movement at the end of the 19th century. Arnold Dolmetsch had a wide circle of friends and admirers, among them the writer George Moore. Another of his champions was George Bernard Shaw who considered the first clavichord which he made in 1894 to be ‘a little masterpiece, which seems to me likely to begin such a revolution in domestic instruments as William Morris&#8217;s work made in domestic furniture and decoration … I therefore estimate the birth of this little clavichord as, on a modern computation, about forty thousand times as important as the Handel Festival&#8217;. One of Arnold Dolmetsch&#8217;s clavichords (M74-1983) made not long after he settled in Haslemere that is in the collection of the Horniman Museum has been used as a source for a recent article in the journal of the International Clavichord Society. Recent acquisitions have cemented the significance of the Horniman&#8217;s holdings in clavichords important to the early music revival, including a rare early example of 1895 by Dolmetsch which had been presumed lost (2015.152).</p>
<p>Dolmetsch&#8217;s close friends and supporters included the poet W. B. Yeats and the artist Sir Edward Burne-Jones, who decorated one of Dolmetsch&#8217;s early clavichords. The impetus for Dolmetsch to make his first harpsichord, the Green Harpsichord, may actually have come from William Morris himself, and the decoration, though never completed, was undertaken by others in the original Arts and Crafts circle: Helen Coombe, Selwyn Image and Herbert Horne. This instrument (M72-1983) has been the subject of recent research by scholars ranging from keyboard specialists to art historians and musicologists.</p>
<p>Instruments by Charles Wheatstone (1802–1875), the inventor of the concertina, form the core of the Wayne collection which was purchased by the Horniman Museum in 1996. The Wheatstone prototypes, patent models and early production models include different types of instruments by the maker: acoustical apparatus, monochord devices and pitch devices. Wheatstone was principally famous as a physicist. His inventions such as the Wheatstone bridge, the Playfair cypher and his innovatory use of electromagnets in electric generators are documented in the <em>Encyclopedia</em><em> Britannica</em>. Research into the ledgers of the Wheatstone concertina factory (available online on <a href="http://www.horniman.info/">http://www.horniman.info</a><a href="http://www.horniman.info/">)</a> shows that the first owner of one of the concertinas in the Horniman collection (M114a-1996) was another famous scientist, Alexander J. Ellis (1814–1890), inventor of the cents system of measuring intervals between musical notes and author of the paper ‘On the musical scales of various nations&#8217;. In keeping with his experiments, this concertina was tuned to ‘just&#8217; intonation, rather than the more conventional equal temperament used today.</p>
<p>In 2003 the Museum loaned to the Wilberforce House Museum for an exhibition on the theme of slavery one of a pair of large Fante drums from Ghana (M32b-1985), that were presented to their donor in 1953 by the then President of the Ekumfi State, Nana Kaykin VI. The drum is displayed as one of the musical instruments of a contemporary West African community whose enslaved members were deported to the Americas. The two drums were tuned around a minor third apart and imitated speech rhythms and tones of the Fante language.</p>
<p>The Boosey &amp; Hawkes collection was begun in the late nineteenth century by David James Blaikley (1846–1936), works manager and instrument designer at Boosey &amp; Co. Blaikley&#8217;s work as an acoustician was pioneering and was presented at the Royal Society. His most important contribution to wind instrument design was the development of a successful compensating valve system, which enabled brass instruments to play better in tune. His compensating systems are still in use today for many of the larger brass instruments such as euphoniums and basses. The Boosey &amp; Hawkes collection includes several prototype compensating instruments made by Blaikley and a number of instruments collected by Blaikley, which still bear labels in his hand.</p>
<p>The collections include examples of instruments owned by notable performers: a Boosey &amp; Hawkes sessionair trumpet made for and played by Grisha Farfel, front man of the Billy Cotton Band; a hallmarked slide trumpet by Köhler that belonged to Thomas Harper Jr, noted virtuoso and trumpeter to Queen Victoria; a basset horn by Pask and several clarinets belonging to Henry Lazarus, noted virtuoso and professor; a <em>tárogató</em> by Schunda, which was brought to England by Hans Richter for performances of Wagner&#8217;s <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>; Northumbrian smallpipes associated with the famed wood engraver Thomas Bewick and <em>Punch</em> cartoonist Charles Keene; and a horn associated with Giovanni Puzzi, a favourite performer of the Duke of Wellington and Queen Victoria.</p>
<h3>Cultural significance</h3>
<p>Musical instruments were among the ethnographical material collected by the anthropologists working from the 1950s until the present time.</p>
<h4>Africa</h4>
<p>Jean Jenkins, the curator of musical instruments from the early 1950s to 1978, made a large collection of musical instruments relating to religious ritual, and sound recordings in Ethiopia in the mid-1960s. This represents the most complete and up-to-date documentation of traditional Ethiopian music before the destruction of that ancient culture in the Marxist revolution; it was complemented by the acquisition of a collection of archival film and photographs assembled by James Potts in the early 1970s.</p>
<h4>Americas</h4>
<p>In 2015 contemporary examples of the percussion instruments played in the street bands of Rio de Janeiro were collected, together with images of video footage of performances on similar examples during Carnival in the city. The instruments and the footage acquired will be shown in the Music Gallery in a section of the exhibition devoted to seasonal festivals.</p>
<h4>Asia</h4>
<p>The Horniman Museum&#8217;s ‘post-Soviet cultures&#8217; collecting project was developed during the mid- to late 1990s, a decade dominated by the seismic shifts in the former republics of the USSR after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Museum made extensive collections of modern examples of traditional instruments from Belarus and Uzbekistan, in collaboration with experts in the field who had made the study of the traditional music of their own cultural areas their life&#8217;s work, and who were able to provide excellent contacts to musical instrument makers and musicians. Thus in Uzbekistan the Museum had the opportunity to document both instruments built for modal scales played solo or in small ensembles for music using a single melodic line, and others that had been adapted to accommodate 12-note chromatic equal-tempered western scales and were played in large folk orchestras, where traditional music was harmonised and treated in the grand symphonic style, a process of eroding traditional material and intangible culture and replacing it with the dominant Russian norms, as documented in A. I. Petrosiants&#8217; <em>Organology: Uzbek folk instruments</em>. Musical instruments from the collection made in Uzbekistan were loaned for an exhibition at the National Museums of Scotland in 2000.</p>
<h4>India</h4>
<p>Frederick Horniman&#8217;s professional interest in tea may have spurred on his journey to India to collect for his museum in 1894 and 1895, where he acquired a number of musical instruments. The Museum added to this collection throughout the 20th century, but with the exception of the percussion instruments and flutes acquired by British missionaries from their converts (marginalised communities of Bhil and Santal whom they described as ‘out-castes&#8217;), most of the instruments that came to the Horniman during that century were associated with Hindustani and Carnatic music – north and south Indian classical music traditions.</p>
<p>In 2000, in collaboration with the British Library Sound Archive, the Museum sponsored a project to make collections that represented some of the regional musical traditions of Indian, and their cultural and linguistic diversity. Musical instruments were commissioned from makers representative of the four main language groups of India (Dravidian, Indo-European, Tibeto-Burman and Austroasiatic). Music and instruments were collected from temple drummers of rural Kerala, musician-farmers from Sora Adivasi communities, monastic and lay communities on the island of Majuli in Assam, and farmers and artisans from the plains of Punjab and the Himalayan mountains of Arunachal Pradesh. Broadcast quality audio and video recordings of the music played on the instruments were acquired by the BLSA, with copies made for the main music archive for ethnomusicology, the ARCE in Harayana, India. These collections and their documentation were displayed in the Horniman Museum&#8217;s temporary exhibition of 2008, <em>Music from India</em>. The involvement of members of London-based communities of Indian heritage was a key element of the exhibition, which showcased their performances and projects. The Horniman also worked with a new museum of Adivasi culture in India for the exhibition. The exhibition generated two conferences: one on Indian music, partnered by the British Forum for Ethnomusicology; and one on museums and empowering marginalised communities, that was held in collaboration with the Bhasha Research and Publication Centre, Vadodara, Gujarat and the University of East Anglia.</p>
<h4>Britain</h4>
<p>England was a renowned centre for the manufacture of viols from the 16th to the 18th centuries, and scholarly surveys of this instrument regularly include examples of Horniman Museum instruments.</p>
<p>The collection of 600+ concertinas and related free reed instruments, together with ledgers and recordings, chronicles the history of the invention of the concertina, one of the very few instruments invented in Britain, and its manufacture in the 19th century. Piano manufacturing was a major industry in London in the 19th century, and the Horniman Museum holds examples of the work of the London-based piano makers Adam Beyer, John Broadwood, Robert Wornum, George Garcka, William Rolfe and John Brinsmead.</p>
<p>The Winds of Change project takes its impetus from the Boosey &amp; Hawkes collection and archive. It is focused on documenting changing orchestral and band instrument design and performance practice in Britain from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century and building a representative collection of instruments. During this period, the instruments used and the sound produced by British players was distinctively different from that of Germany and America. In the early 20th century, English orchestras began to tour internationally and German and American orchestras visited Britain. World War II accelerated the travel of musicians and instruments. Soon after, most wind players throughout Europe and the US used similar instruments and distinctive national schools were replaced by a homogeneous sound. The recent closure of the Besson factory in London, Britain&#8217;s last large-scale instrument manufacturer, has underscored the importance of building a systematic collection of British instruments from this period and of documenting the stories of their makers and players. This research was supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, which granted two Collaborative Doctoral Awards to the Horniman Museum and Goldsmiths College to enable two students to undertake PhD research on this topic using the Boosey &amp; Hawkes collection and archive.</p>
<h3>Technical or operational significance</h3>
<p>Wind instruments in the Carse collection have been used as sources in a number of works of reference tracing the evolution of different wind instruments. The Leslie Stephen collection of models of 81 piano actions provides a comprehensive overview of the development of the piano.</p>
<p>In 1960 a modest but representative collection of seven guitars was given to the Museum by Terence Usher, Professor of Guitar at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. These were carefully selected by Prof Usher in order to illustrate the principal lines of development of guitar design from the end of the 18th century until a little after the middle of the 19th century, a period of major change in which the Spanish guitar changed from a smallbodied instrument of simple internal construction, to an instrument whose body encloses approximately double the air-space and whose belly is supported by a complex bracing system designed to produce the maximum volume of sound and depth of tone.</p>
<p>The Wayne concertina collection chronicles the development of the instrument, and the different types and systems developed by all known British and some continental makers. A catalogue was acquired with the collection, documenting the evolution of the concertina with illustrations of almost every instrument in the collection. Over 129 specimens of various early and later models of the Wheatstone concertina and related prototypes and patent models are represented here. This section of the collection, with a diagnostic analysis of the features of the earliest concertinas is described in an article by Neil Wayne in the <em>Galpin Society Journal</em>. The collection has an extensive archive including the Wheatstone factory day books from 1830 to 1891 and diary from 1866 to 1894. This provides valuable evidence regarding the organisation of a musical instrument factory in London in the 19th century.</p>
<p>The Boosey &amp; Hawkes collection was the museum collection of the Boosey &amp; Hawkes company. It was established by the company as a resource for instrument makers and designers, and therefore focused on technologically significant and/or innovative instruments. As such they still have iconic status: three oboes from this collection by Triébert using different key systems were lent to the Royal Academy of Music&#8217;s temporary exhibition <em>Re-thinking the oboe</em> in 2013. The Boosey &amp; Hawkes archive comprises a comprehensive sequence of instrument production records for the firm and its predecessors, product catalogues, ephemera and approximately 3,000 technical drawings of musical instruments and instrument making tools. The archive provides an unprecedented level of information about instrument manufacture, use and design. This allows the history of surviving instruments to be traced by serial number and also enables researchers to gain a much more accurate view of instrument production and consumption than can be gained by studying instruments alone.</p>
<h3>The role of the collections and archives in research</h3>
<p>In addition to the illustrative examples cited above, the collections and archives are regularly referred to in refereed journals, research publications, books and the popular press. References frequently appear in leading scholarly publications focusing on musical instruments such as the <em>Galpin Society Journal</em>, the <em>Journal of the American Musical Instrument </em><em>Society</em> and the <em>Historic Brass Society Journal</em>. Instruments and archives have also been cited in more broadly focused musicological journals such as <em>Early Music</em> and the <em>Royal Musical Association Research Chronicle</em>. Over fifty citations to Horniman instruments appear in articles in the <em>New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</em> and the <em>New Grove Dictionary of Musical Instruments</em>. Collections and archives also attract the attention of the popular press. Articles in <em>The Guardian</em>, <em>The Times</em> and <em>Classical Music Magazine</em> recognised the importance of the Boosey &amp; Hawkes collection and archive to national heritage.The Museum&#8217;s instruments and archives are also regularly referred to in papers presented at international conferences, many of which are associated with the societies mentioned above. The profile of Horniman instruments and archives is also growing online through academic sites such as the lists of surviving instruments by various makers maintained by Edinburgh University, the Galpin Society and the serial number information drawn from the Wheatstone production records at <a href="http://www.concertina.com/">concertina.com</a><a href="http://www.concertina.com/">.</a> Horniman instruments also feature in the recent MINIM-UK project, in which musical instruments in UK collections appear online, sometimes accompanied, as in the case of the Horniman&#8217;s Kirckman harpsichord (1972.211), with audiovisual examples. These object records were subsequently exported to the MIMO website that holds the world&#8217;s largest database of musical instruments.</p>
<p>Horniman Museum instruments and archives have become an increasingly important resource for university teaching as well as for individual researchers. Goldsmiths College and the Courtauld Institute are among those who regularly make use of these resources in their teaching.</p>
<h2>Overview of existing Natural History collection</h2>
<h3>Quality and variety of collection</h3>
<p>Natural History contains over 250,000 specimens of local, national and worldwide origin. The collection includes several thousand specimens acquired in the 19th century as part of the original Horniman bequest. Many thousands more specimens were added throughout the 20th and early 21st centuries for the purpose of display, education, reference and research. The collection is varied and contains a range of biological and geological material and its associated data. This includes taxidermy mounts, study skins, articulated skeletons and bones, dried pressed plants, mollusc shells, birds&#8217; eggs, pinned insects, freeze-dried specimens, histological slides, models, fluid-preserved material, fossils, minerals and rocks. The collection also contains a small number of human osteological remains. Some parts of the collection have associated field notebooks, photographs and other archival information which enhances their significance and increases their potential for study in areas of ecology, conservation biology, environmental science, evolutionary biology and taxonomy.</p>
<h3>Collections of comparable significance</h3>
<p>The Horniman Natural History collection is the third largest in London outside the Natural History Museum and Royal Botanic Gardens Kew. Nationally, the collection is comparable in size and function to many other medium-sized regional museums in Britain. Whilst the Horniman does not hold large numbers of specimens of major scientific importance, such as significant numbers of type specimens, it does hold some specimens of international scientific and cultural importance collected from the 19th to the 21st centuries. These are considered in more detail below. In addition to the stored Natural History material, the Horniman is fortunate to retain a sizable Natural History gallery dating from the turn of the 20th century. This contains around 4,000 individual specimens, generally acquired during the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<h3>Scientific importance</h3>
<h4>The Horniman Insect Collection</h4>
<p>Frederick Horniman amassed a world-wide collection of butterflies, beetles and other insects, most of which are retained within the Museum&#8217;s collection. The collection contains one of the surviving type specimens of <em>Papilio hornimani</em>, the Horniman Swallowtail first described and illustrated by the Victorian entomologist W. L. Distant in the <em>Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London</em> in 1879. More than a century later, Vane-Wright published further work on the taxonomy and conservation of this species, a butterfly that is only known from the northern group of forests in Tanzania and the Chyulu Hills of southern Kenya.</p>
<p>The insect collection also contains specimens of several other species described and named in honour of Frederick Horniman: the moth, <em>Eusemia hornimani</em>, (now <em>Heraclia hornimani</em>); a true bug, <em>Tesserotoma &gt;hornimani</em>; and the ‘Horniman beetle&#8217;, <em>Ceratorhina hornimani</em> (now <em>Cyprolais hornimanni</em>), from Cameroon, first described by naturalist and explorer Henry Walter Bates in 1877. Many more specimens were collected by famous 19th-century collectors, explorers and entomologists, including Alfred Russell Wallace, mostly from west and east Africa, Asia and South America, with accompanying descriptions published in scientific journals during the latter half of the 19th century.</p>
<h4>Hymenoptera Ichneumonidae – parasitic wasps</h4>
<p>Between 1992 and 2006, Dr J. P. Brock added over 10,000 specimens, mostly Ichneumonidae or parasitic wasps, to the Museum&#8217;s collection of British insects. Most were collected from National Nature Reserves and Sites of Special Scientific Interest in the south east of England. Many specimens were also identified, published and added to the collection by specialists from the UK, Germany, Poland, Finland and France. The collection of Ichneumonidae includes species and specimens that are first records for Britain, with little or no representation in other museums. In 2017, a full taxonomic revision to the 138 British species of Banchine wasps was published by J. P. Brock and includes the designation of several type (name bearing) specimens held in the Horniman collection or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Dr Mark Shaw, former Keeper of Geology and Zoology, National Museums of Scotland wrote in 1997:</p>
<p><em>There are only two other large and active collections of Ichneumonidae in the UK (both in National Museums) and only about half a dozen other museums in Britain have worthwhile holdings even of less actively used (older) material. The Horniman Museum is one of only 2 or 3 centres where the specimens provide a good snap-shot of species representation, distribution and abundance in a particular period of time, and also where modern taxonomic identification has taken place.</em></p>
<p>A similar view was expressed by Dr Gavin Broad, Curator of Hymenoptera at the Natural History Museum in 2007, who adds:</p>
<p>This collection is particularly rich in specimens from lowland heaths and fens. Lowland heaths are poorly represented in the major collections of Ichneumonidae in the UK. The collection includes some ‘type&#8217; specimens and more will result from the forthcoming revision of the British Banchinae.</p>
<h4>Early stages of Lepidoptera</h4>
<p>The insect collection at the Horniman Museum also contains valuable specimens of the early stages of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), including a comprehensive larval collection of British species and some unique world material of strategic importance for work on evolutionary relationships. These include rare families such as Callidulidae (from field work in Sri Lanka), Mnesarcheidae (New Zealand), Carposinidae (Japan), Schreckensteineidae (UK) and Mimallonidae (Brazil); and also the Zygaenoid group (including ontogenic series material for Heterogynidae).</p>
<h4>The Bennett Fossil Collection</h4>
<p>In 1987, the Museum acquired the collection of the amateur fossil collector and past president of Croydon Natural History Society, Walter H. Bennett (1892–1971). This is a large collection that comprises over 175,000 individual fossil specimens. It covers geological periods from the Cambrian to more recent times. Bennett travelled extensively, collecting fossils from many parts of the world. Most came from Britain and Europe and include material collected from important geological sites such as the Solnhofen limestone in Germany and other European locations, for example, Italy, France and Cyprus. Other material was collected from farther afield. The collection contains a small number of specimens from the Burgess Shale in Canada, one of the first designated World Heritage Sites, where it is now almost impossible to collect. Specimens from other significant North American sites, including the Green River Eocene Shales, are also present in the collection.</p>
<p>Writing in 1993 on the significance of the Bennett collection, P. Doughty, former Keeper of Geology at the Ulster Museum, stated</p>
<p><em>This is a research collection of consistently high standard and contains material from classic sites in Europe and North America of particular value for future research. Long series from South London, Surrey and Kent give added value and dimension to the collection.</em></p>
<p>In 1971, C. P. Nuttall of the then British Museum (Natural History) also underlined the scarcity and value of many items in the collection. This was reiterated more recently by Matthew Parkes,Geology Curator at the National Museum of Ireland, who conducted a review of the collection in 2013.</p>
<h4>Wyatt Geology Collection</h4>
<p>This collection contains examples of rocks, minerals and fossils, mostly collected around the British Isles by the amateur field geologist Arthur Wyatt (1910–1977). Approximately 1700 specimens were collected throughout the1960s and 1970s. The collection contains excellent data including detailed field notes and reference photographs of the geographical localities where specimens were collected. Each specimen also has an associated grid reference. Few of our geological specimens contain such precise information about where the specimens were collected, adding further value to their potential for use in research.</p>
<h3>Historic and Cultural Significance</h3>
<h4>Horniman&#8217;s taxidermy collection</h4>
<p>The Horniman bequest originally contained a number of taxidermy mounts donated or purchased from the naturalist and hunter James Hubbard. These were originally displayed in the Canadian section of the Colonial and Indian Exhibition, South Kensington, London in 1886.The collection included several large taxidermy mounts, a Polar Bear, Moose and our well known Walrus. Most of these were de-accessioned and removed from the Museum in 1948. Only the Walrus and some smaller taxidermy mounts remain in the collection today.</p>
<h4>The Hart Bird Collection</h4>
<p>Edward Hart (1847–1928) was a fine exponent of the genre of display of mounted birds as they would have been seen in their natural environment. Although the original concept is said to have been developed by E. T. Booth, whose collection is housed in the Booth Museum, Royal Pavilion and Museums Brighton and Hove, Hart not only recreated the ground and trees from which his birds came, but also displayed them against painted backgrounds. The Horniman Museum holds the greater bulk of Hart&#8217;s material, extending to 250 cases and totalling nearly 1,000 individual specimens. Dr P. A. Morris, Britain&#8217;s leading scholar on the history of taxidermy writes:</p>
<p>With the 20th century came an awakening interest in ecology and behaviour. Hart&#8217;s cases show that well. They encapsulate more than just the bird&#8217;s structure and taxonomic status. This dichotomy of views on taxidermy display strategy is well documented in the literature. Whilst others also created diorama style cases, Hart managed to achieve extraordinary effects with perspective (unrivalled by anyone else, especially in comparatively small cases) and created an illusion of space within a glass fronted box that nobody else has yet matched. The collection remains largely intact when so many similar collections by Gentleman Naturalists (themselves an important social phenomenon) have been broken up or lost to neglect. The collection is well documented in Hart&#8217;s own notebooks; few collections have this amount of information about the specimens.</p>
<h4>Other collections</h4>
<p>Other parts of the collections which have a strong scientific or historical significance include;</p>
<ul>
<li>good quality mounts of two extinct species, the Huia Bird (New Zealand) and Passenger Pigeon (North America);</li>
<li>cast material of <em>Homo mousteriensis hauseri</em>: made from the original type, which was destroyed during WWII, this is the only extant first generation cast and is of considerable international importance;</li>
<li>the Moore Collection of tropical butterflies and other orders contains specimens collected around the world from the 19th century to the 1950s and is likely to contain some important unpublished material;</li>
<li>the J. Platt Barrett Collection of butterflies and months from Britain and Sicily contains, amongst other specimens, a much figured specimen of the Marbled White <em>Melanargia </em><em>galathea</em>;</li>
<li>the Collins collection of British Coleoptera contains material determined by important authorities such as Last, Britten and Donisthorpe;</li>
<li>material collected on the HMS Challenger Expedition and Second Byrd Antarctic Expedition;</li>
<li>various animal skulls from the collection of the Royal College of Surgeons, illustrated in J. F. Colyer&#8217;s <em>Variations and diseases of the teeth of animals</em>.</li>
<li>Gorilla skull (NH.H.2), figured in Gorilla Pathology and Health with a Catalogue of Preserved Materials, 2017.</li>

				     	<p>The collection was initiated under the founding curator Mervyn Palmer, when the museum was established in 1932. Donations of large amounts of natural history, especially taxidermy, formed a major part of the museum’s early collection. Local donors predominated, and Mr Palmer actively sought to acquire a reference collection of lepidoptera, by corresponding with the RAMM in Exeter and museums in London. Early accession registers 1932-1969 provide reasonable details. The museum had an ‘anything and everything’ attitude to collecting, which has given the museum its eclectic character, but led to storage problems by the 1990s, since when the collecting has been gradually more selective. Documentation was poor from 1969-1985.</p>
<p>From 1986 accessions were recorded to museum standards, and the museum began a new numbering system using the MLA prefix ILFCM. There was much re-organisation of the poorly stored and displayed material in the 1990s and 2000s.</p>
<p>In 2014 the museum began to digitise the collection onto MODES and E-Hive databases.</p>
<p>There are important collections of African ethnography and South American archaeology, and archives on Mervyn Palmers career, significant because he was a professional collector. A set of First World War photographs of the town’s soldiers has recently been recognised as a rare type of collection. There is now a need to conduct more research into the origins and significance of parts of the collection – for example an herbarium recently found in the loft, and the provenance and importance of the extensive lepidoptera collection.</p>

				     	<h2>States of Jersey</h2>
<p>The States of Jersey, their Committees and Administrations are required, under the Public Records (Jersey) Law, 2002 to transfer all archival material to Jersey Heritage to be stored at the Jersey Archive. Approximately 80% of collections held at the Jersey Archive are Public Records. Jersey Heritage is also responsible for a museum-related collection of artefacts and paintings belonging to the States of Jersey. Finds resulting from archaeological investigations on States land or property will remain the property of the States but are placed in the care of the Jersey Heritage. States collections make up 28% of the museum holdings.</p>
<h2>Société Jersiaise</h2>
<p>The majority of the social history and archaeology museum collections in the care of Jersey Heritage, 57% is in the ownership of the Société Jersiaise, having been built up by the Société and its members over more than a hundred years.</p>
<h2>Jersey Heritage</h2>
<p>Since its formation in 1980, Jersey Heritage has purchased and commissioned paintings and other works of art as well as buying other historic items, these objects make up 12% of the museum collections. 5% of archive collections from private institutions and individuals have been donated to Jersey Heritage.</p>
<h2>Private Individuals/Businesses/Associations</h2>
<p>15% of archival collections in the care of Jersey Heritage are deposited by private individuals, businesses and associations on a signed long-term deposit arrangement. Jersey Heritage also has custody of a small museum collection belonging to the National Trust for Jersey which makes up 2% of the museum collections. The museum collections also include a small proportion of private loans from individuals, not exceeding 1% of the total.</p>

				     	<p>Jersey Heritage cares for a unique collection of artefacts, works of art, archival material, archaeological material, specimens and information relating to the history, culture and environment of the Bailiwick of Jersey.</p>
<p>The general policy of Jersey Heritage is to collect artefacts and archival items associated with the art, human history and natural history of Jersey from the earliest times to the present day. There is a general presumption, established in 1930, against the collection of objects with no connection with the Island except where they are to be used for comparative purposes. Where relevant, however, objects are collected from individuals and organisations outside the Island.</p>
<p>It is recognised that there is in Jersey a number of collections of international importance that have been assembled over the years by Island residents. This policy does not preclude the acquisition of such collections for the future benefit of the public of the Island.</p>

				     	<p>Jewish Museum London’s collections include those from the first Jewish Museum in 1932, to the Museum of the Jewish East End (founded, 1983) which ran in parallel to each other before amalgamating on one site to form the new Jewish Museum London in 2010.</p>
<h3>2.1 Jewish Museum 1932-1995</h3>
<p>The first collections were acquired by the volunteer-run Jewish Museum based in Bloomsbury Square in 1932. Among its initial acquisitions were items from one of the first Judaica collections in the country that were on sale at the time, the Arthur Howitt Collection, later joined by Judaica from the Arthur Franklin collection. Many outstanding items of Judaica (including synagogue silver and textiles and items used for private worship) were collected under the leadership of Wilfred Samuel &#8211; chairman of the committee from its inception to his death in 1958. He was succeeded by Alfred Rubens, who had joined as its expert on prints and drawings and continued as chairman for the next twenty-five years.  Over time, the museum committee also collected social history items with the caveat, however, that they should be at least 100 years old, which meant that they tended to omit the history of the late 19th century onwards. The focus was on rare and outstanding items. An important early acquisition was (in 1932) a fine 17th century synagogue ark, discovered at Chillingham Castle in Northumberland. Another substantial addition was the bequest of a beautiful collection of over 1,500 paintings, prints and drawings by Alfred Rubens, spanning from the 18th to the 20th centuries to the collection, in the 1990s.</p>
<h3>2.2 Jewish East End Museum / Museum of the Jewish East End / London Museum of Jewish Life 1983-1995</h3>
<p>The London Museum of Jewish Life had independently come into existence in 1983 under the name Jewish East End Museum (later: Museum of the Jewish East End) with the aim to collect and document the history of the Jewish East End of London and salvage cultural heritage of that area. Collecting activity focused on the everyday life of the immigrants and acquisitions included materials relating to working life (e.g. tailoring, cabinetmaking), social and political activity, local charities (e.g. Jews’ Temporary Shelter) and home life (household materials). The museum collected numerous photographs and documents and recorded oral histories. In 1988 the museum changed the name to the London Museum of Jewish Life and expanded its collecting policy to reflect the diversity of Jewish roots and life in Britain.</p>
<h3>2.3 Jewish Museum London 1995-2010 (operating on two sites), 2010-2023 (Camden)</h3>
<p>In 1995 the Jewish Museum was amalgamated with the London Museum of Jewish Life, first operating on a two-site basis under the directorship of Rickie Burman. In the same year it acquired the archive of Holocaust survivor Leon Greenman, of whom the Holocaust gallery centred on.  In 1997 the Jewish Museum was awarded Designated status by the Museums and Galleries Commission in recognition of the outstanding importance of its Judaica collections as part of the national heritage. In 2010 the two collections were amalgamated under one roof. An important new acquisition was a 13th century mikveh, excavated in the City of London, the largest and one of the oldest exhibits at the museum. In 2015, an agreement with the Jewish Military Museum following their closure, assigned the Jewish Museum responsibility for the management, accessibility and engagement with their collection of military items.</p>
<h3>2.4 Covid 19 pandemic and new operating model, 2020-2023</h3>
<p>In 2020, the global COVID-19 pandemic led to a temporary pause in acquiring new items (March 2020-Jan 2021) and a subsequent change in direction established programmes such as ‘Inclusive Judaism’ which encourages the acquisition of items from underrepresented groups (see Appendix 1). In 2023, the Museum closed and sold its Camden building in order to release funds to be financially sustainable, and accelerate the vision to develop a new Jewish Museum London for the future. The Museum is now operating as a ‘Museum Without Walls’ expanding its loans programme and museum curated displayed hosted by external venues; items from the core collection feature in regularly changing displays at JW3, the National Holocaust Centre and Museum, Bradford Reform Synagogue. Throughout 2024, items will be on display in at least five regions of the UK; London, Manchester, Bradford, Nottingham, &amp; Brighton, with plans to expand our outreach and display potential in the coming years. Aside from items on display, the collection has been transferred into storage with Queens Fine Arts, a company approved by both our Board of Trustees and insurers. The collection can be accessed by staff for Museum projects and research requests.</p>
<p>Acquisitions were paused from July 2023 to April 2024.</p>
<p>The long-term agreement with the Jewish Military Museum and associated loan of their collection ceased with collections management responsibilities returning to the Jewish Military Association (AJEX) in 2023.</p>

				     	<p>The Jewish Museum London collection contains over 32,000 items including a Judaica collection with Designation Collection1 status as recognised by Arts Council England. It has a combination of items that reflect the religious traditions and practices, alongside those that illustrate the history and culture of Jewish people in Britain. It seeks to reflect the diverse roots of the Jewish community in Britain, including Ashkenazi, Sephardi &amp; Mizrachi traditions, however, the collection is more heavily weighted towards Ashkenazi material. The earliest material dates to the medieval 11th century with a small percentage of items relating to 17th/18th century and a higher concentration of objects dating to the 19th century onwards. The collection includes items that reflect the roots and identities of Jewish people in Britain, including their countries of origin (primarily European countries). This has led to certain items having tenuous links to British Jewry through association rather than a direct connection. The collection aims to represent Jews from all cultural, ethnic, religious and sexual backgrounds that reflect the Jewish population of Britain past and present.</p>
<h3>Designated Collection</h3>
<p>3.1 Judaica (representing the religious aspects of Judaism)  Primarily collected by the early Jewish Museum, items consist of those used in the synagogue (eg Torah ornaments), home (eg Hanukah lamps) or by individuals (eg amulets). There is overlap with the textile collection (e.g. Torah mantles, kippot, tefillin) and books/manuscript/documents collection (e.g. synagogue records, ketubot (marriage certificates), &amp; Mizrach) The Judaica collection includes silverware and other metals (e.g. rimmonim), glass and ceramic (e.g. Sabbath lamps), textiles (e.g. tallitot) and paper-based items (e.g. Haggadah).</p>
<h3>Non Designated Collections</h3>
<p>3.2 Social History (representing the history and culture of Jews in Britain) Primarily collected by the Museum of Jewish Life, items consist of secular objects often connected with communal activities (eg trophies, regalia), domestic items (eg cooking equipment) and personal items (eg jewellery). There is overlap with the costume/textile collection (e.g. wedding dresses) and with books/manuscripts/documents (e.g. memoires, personal letters, magazines) and the art collections (prints/paintings/photographs) The social history collection includes silverware and other metals (trophies), glass and ceramic (e.g. figurines), and ephemera (e.g. Bar mitzvah invitations).</p>
<p>3.3 Working History (representing the industries and working life of Jews in Britain) The collection is mainly made of items from the 19th and 20th century representing the East End industries following the great migration. Well-represented trades include tailoring, cabinet making, baking, printing, hat making and cigarette making. Later 20th century material includes well known businesses such as Boris Bennett photographic studios to the more obscure such as the Massil Master Bowling Pin.</p>
<p>3.4 Military History (representing the history of Jewish military service)  Items relating to Jewish military history include a range of service medals, prayer books, correspondence, and photographs.</p>
<p>3.5 Costume &amp; Textile (representing both items of religion and social /working history)  Items relating to a religious context are centred on synagogue textiles, (e.g. Ark curtains and Torah mantles 17th &#8211; 20th century) and those used in the home such as challah covers, or items of personal piety such as prayer shawls.  Non-religious textiles include a range of domestic items (eg tablecloths) and several banners from communal organisations, including one of only two surviving Jewish trade union banners. Costumes are primarily late 19th and 20th century, including wedding dresses, uniforms, clothing accessories (eg handbags, shoes and hats) and baby clothes (including circumcision gowns). They also reflect diverse traditions of Jewish costume throughout the world, including Baghdadi Indian clothes and a Bukharian barmitzvah robe. There are also two concentration camp uniforms and several costumes from Yiddish theatre actors.</p>
<p>3.6 Prints &amp; Drawings (2D artwork exc. paintings) The Rubens collection makes up one of the world’s most important collections of Jewish prints with depictions of religious ceremonies and practices, Jewish costume, portraits of famous Jews, and caricatures by masters such as Rowlandson and Gillray. It also holds additional prints and drawings collected by the museum, including work by Simeon Solomon, and Eva Frankfurther, alongside cartoons, sketches and collages.</p>
<p>3.7 Paintings &amp; Sculpture (2D &amp; 3D works of art) The museum holds a small collection of primarily 18th and 19th century oil paintings and miniatures of historical interest. There are also a limited number of small busts and sculptures either by Jewish artists or depicting Jewish individuals.</p>
<p>3.8 Archaeology &amp; coins The museum has a small collection of classical, Middle Eastern and medieval coins, medals and seals, and occasional archaeological pieces (eg Sumerian clay bowl).</p>
<p>3.9 Books, manuscripts &amp; documents  The book collection includes both religious and secular books, printed in a range of languages, including English, Hebrew, Yiddish and German, from the 17th to the 20th century. There are also bound religious registers. Books in the collection are treated as museum objects, rather than reference sources. In the event of disposal, any religious books must be disposed of according to appropriate religious custom. There is a wide range of both religious and secular manuscripts, documents and ephemera in the collection, dating from the 17th century to the present day. The 19th/ 20th century is heavily represented with synagogue records and ephemera, ketubot (marriage certificates), amulets and other religious documentation, trade cards, bookplates, posters, invitations, scrapbooks, account books and ledgers, newspapers, magazines and annual reports. Personal papers and records include letters, diaries, certificates, ID cards and passports. There is a fine collection of posters, playbills and other ephemera relating to Yiddish theatre in London.</p>
<p>3.10 Photographs The museum holds both original photographs and an archive of historical and contemporary images. Original photographs are primarily gelatin silver prints, with a very small number of daguerrotypes and albumen prints. There are also large framed items and photographs housed in albums and scrapbooks. The majority of images in the collection are copy prints in the Photographic Archive, generated from original photographs loaned to the museum for this purpose. Originally in the format of 35mm negatives, these images are now produced digitally and housed on the museum’s computer network. Photographs illustrate the full range of the museum’s collecting interests, including people, places, activities and areas of origin. The museum has collected photographs of all aspects of Jewish life, with a more recent focus on documenting contemporary life and representing the broad Jewish spectrum. It does not collect unidentified photographs.  All new acquisitions must have their copyright status assessed and cleared (where possible) and take data protection issues into account.</p>
<p>3.11 Oral History The museum’s Oral History Archive consists of personal histories, working life and communal activities, and include interviews with refugees from Nazism, Holocaust survivors and others who have come to Britain from around the world. Copyright in all interviews is cleared at point of recording. Most audio is on cassette tape with a combination of digitised mp3/wav. Versions, and /or a transcription.</p>
<p>3.12 Audio-Visual collections  The museum holds a small archive of audio-visual material. This is primarily reference material on VHS or DVD, with a few examples of archival footage. Copyright for reference material has generally not been cleared. Recent audio/visual acquisitions have been restricted to digital versions only.</p>
<p>3.13 Holocaust collections Items relating to the Holocaust are primarily from the archive of Leon Greenman, with additional items relating to kindertransport testimony. There is also a small collection of antisemitic items from the time, and liberator photography.</p>

				     	<p>The collection at Keswick Museum and Art Gallery was founded by the local Literary and Scientific Society in 1873, with a particular focus on Natural Sciences. The collection of random, chance finds of local, natural and antiquarian interest was quickly focused under several local naturalists and geologists, including James Clifton Ward, to active systematic collecting. A number of pieces were bought including Flintoft&#8217;s model of the Lake District, while the bequest of James Edmonson&#8217;s butterfly collection forms a focus of the entomological collections today. The important literary collections were begun when Canon H D Rawnsley, one of the founders of the National Trust, became a Fitz Park Trustee in the early part of the twentieth century. His fame brought donations and bequest from many quarters including members of the Southey family. The collection is largely provenanced to Keswick and the North Lakes.</p>
<p>The Museum was governed by the Fitz Park Trust until it ran into financial difficulties in 1994, at which time the Keswick Museum and Art Gallery Trust was formed, with Allerdale Borough Council as Trustee. In 2003 the Museums collections were formally acknowledged as existing and the collection was transferred to the trust.</p>
<p>In 2007 the management of the Museum was delegated to Keswick Museum and Art Gallery Management Limited from Allerdale Borough Council.</p>
<p>A major building refurbishment was completed in 2014, allowing more space for exhibitions as well as being able to develop more commercial activity to support the sustainability of the museum.</p>

				     	<h2>Archaeology</h2>
<p>The small collection comprises mainly Cumbrian artefacts, deriving from a number of sources including bequests, excavations and casual finds. This material can be placed in three categories: Pre-history, Roman, and Medieval.</p>
<h3>Pre-history</h3>
<p>There is a significant collection of worked Neolithic axes from the Langdale axe making sites including rough outs and finished axes, all found within the North Lakes area. Additionally there are several bronzes weapons and two Iron Age bangles from the west of Thirlmere.</p>
<h3>Roman</h3>
<p>The Roman collection is a small number of ceramic sherds from Samian to lower wares, including some from different local sites, and a few unprovenanced coins.</p>
<h3>Medieval</h3>
<p>The collection is a small number of ceramic sherds from key local sites such as Lords Island, seat of the Earls of Derwentwater, and a recently acquired lead seal and crucifix mould. Tullie House Museum in Carlisle holds the premier collection of archaeological material from Allerdale, ranging from excavation archives through to specific pieces such as the Cockermouth gold neck ring.</p>
<h2>Social History</h2>
<h3>Costume &amp; Textiles</h3>
<p>The collection includes little costume material except for the Flather costume collection, comprising non-local 1920s and 30s daily wear and accessories. Also John Ruskin’s court suit; Robert Southey’s shoes; wedding and may queen outfits.</p>
<h3>Domestic: leisure/pastimes</h3>
<p>This collection includes pastimes, sport and music, especially the famous Musical Stones. The Museum has three sets of stones and a significant archive of associated material.</p>
<h3>Work: industrial, commercial, maritime, agriculture</h3>
<p>This area of the collection concentrates on pencil and bobbin manufacture; Cockermouth, Keswick &amp; Penrith Railway; Keswick Gas, Light &amp; Coke Company; tourism &amp; hospitality; shops; quarrying &amp; mining (very little material).</p>
<h3>Community: schools, religion, political/military</h3>
<p>The collection includes local primary and secondary schools; churches; Keswick Convention; festivals; celebrities such as Sir J G Woodford. The collection features a significant model – Flintoft’s relief map of Cumbria, made in 1834 and material relating to the Keswick Convention.</p>
<h2>Natural Sciences</h2>
<h3>Vertebrate Zoology</h3>
<p>The collection includes the display collection of mounted British birds and mammals, some not found in Cumbria today, some osteological material, and several hundred clutches of birds eggs and nests. This collection at Keswick Museum and Art Gallery formed the original basis of the Museum and most specimens date from the nineteenth and twentieth century. Most is of local and regional significance with some specimens of national interest, such as the Vendace, a local relict of the ice age, together with published examples of taxidermy, for example, Greenwell Blackett’s Buzzard. Most have close associations with notable local naturalists such as Joseph Flintoft, and Linneas Eden Hope who helped develop the collections.</p>
<h3>Invertebrate Zoology</h3>
<p>Keswick Museum houses a large entomological collection of mainly British Lepidoptera and Micro-Lepidoptera, and a comprehensive collection of local Coleoptera. The collection includes fish, reptiles, and amphibians, preserved wet, dried and mounted, with a significant collection of freshwater and marine shells from Britain and the world.</p>
<h3>Botany</h3>
<p>The herbarium at Keswick Museum and Art Gallery includes over 1000 sheets of pressed material.</p>
<h3>Geology (rocks, minerals and fossils)</h3>
<p>Keswick Museum and Art Gallery contains an important collection of rocks, minerals and fossils including the collection assembled by James Clifton Ward who surveyed the geology of Keswick for the British Geological Survey. The size and information associated with elements of this collection makes it of regional significance. The geology collection contains a good balance of rocks, minerals &amp; fossils, mostly from local sites and well representing the complex local geology, industrial activity and the work of important nineteenth century collectors. A large proportion of the mineral and rocks are from named collections, including those of Ward, Robert Harkness, John Postlethwaite and Jonathan Otley, all early geology pioneers. The Museum also holds a small collection of minerals collected by John Ruskin, the great Victorian author, artist and social reformer and has specimens donated by twentieth century geologists such as Edgar Shackleton. Cumbria has the greatest number of mineral species in the country and the minerals of the Caldbeck Fells, an internationally important mineralogical area, now collecting restricted, are well represented, including many irreplaceable specimens. Local commercial exploitation and use of stone is also documented in the collections. Graptolites and other marine fauna of the Skiddaw Slates are well represented in the fossil collection, with some type and figured material of national importance. Plant fossils of the Coal Measures are also well represented and the Museum has one specimen of reptile footprints in Eden Valley Sandstone.</p>
<h2>Fine and Decorative Art</h2>
<h3>Fine Art (Oils, Prints, Watercolours)</h3>
<p>A collection of prints, watercolours, oils and drawings covering the period c.1700 to the present day, with the majority of the works dating from the nineteenth century. The collection is primarily of works on paper, of regional significance. The exceptions are nationally important works by Nash and Westall, primarily of nineteenth century Southey family portraits and contemporary views, and a significant collection of watercolours and etchings by Brangwyn. Other notable artists include Sir Charles Holmes, Collingwood and Longmire. The easel paintings are again mainly nineteenth century in date and of regional importance, though the collection does include a number of works by James Durden; a portrait of Robert Southey by Opie; a Redpath oil; a large oil of Waterfall at Keswick by Joseph Farington.</p>
<h3>Metal and Glass</h3>
<p>The collection mainly consists of Arts &amp; Craft metal work from the Keswick School of Industrial Arts (KSIA), founded by Canon H D and Edith Rawnsley in 1884. The collection includes some early pieces of repousse and chased copper articles, by named artists including W H Mawson and a portrait of Rawnsley in bronze relief by Edith Maryon, and various sporting trophies and shields, some silver, but the bulk is later stainless steel commemorative ware. There are also some KSIA fixtures and fittings in the building itself. The Goldscope Cup is a fine piece of silversmithing, but its main importance lies in the locally sourced silver. There is a nationally important bust of Hugh Walpole by Epstein.</p>
<h3>Ceramics</h3>
<p>The collection holds a very small collection of ceramics: Robert Southey’s tea service; a cup &amp; saucer from Peter Crosthwaite’s museum reputedly made for Napoleon.</p>
<h3>Furniture</h3>
<p>A small eclectic collection includes a large parish trunk; John Peel’s chair; Southey’s chair and writing desk; Wonderful Walker bobbin chair; Radcliffe arms chair.</p>
<h2>Archive Material</h2>
<p>The core of the archive is the literary collection of manuscripts; letters, poems and prose and associated material of the Lake Poets and writers, especially Robert Southey who lived in Keswick for 40 years, and, to a lesser degree his contemporaries; William Wordsworth, De Quincey, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Later authors Hugh Walpole, Canon H D Rawnsley and John Ruskin are also well represented. The Southey collection has been built up over several decades primarily from donations and bequests made by members of the Southey family, including a recent bequest of many unpublished letters and early manuscripts of published poems. It is an internationally important archive, in the top 10 repositories of Southey material in the Country. The Museum also holds a quantity of correspondence and manuscript material from Peter Crosthwaite. The Museum has an important collection of geological maps associated with James Clifton Ward, who surveyed the area for the British Geological Survey, and other locally significant archives, including that of the Fitz Park Trust who used to own and manage the Museum. The strengths of the library lie in the areas of early tourism and nineteenth century guidebooks, and geology, and the Museum holds a run of the weekly newspaper, the English Lakes Visitor &amp; Keswick Guardian, from the 1870s to 1910. The photographic archive details the work of important local photographers; the Abrahams, Maysons and Pettitts. The Abrahams firm in particular holds national significance as photographers of pioneering mountaineering climbs locally and elsewhere.</p>

				     	<p>Leicester (now New Walk) Museum (&amp; Art Gallery) was one of the first local authority museums to be opened under the 1846 Act of Parliament &#8220;For Encouraging the Establishment of Museums in Large Towns&#8221;. The founding collection was the gift of the Leicester Literary and Philosophical Society, who since 1835 had gathered a range of items for reference and study. This was mainly made up of natural science specimens, but also included archaeology and items of antiquarian interest such as casts of official seals. In order to provide permanent public access to the collection, during the late 1840s the Society offered its collection of around 10,000 objects to Leicester Council in return for the Council agreeing to purchase and fit-out a former school building and run it jointly with the Society as a free museum. This opened in 1849.</p>
<p>The opening of the museum stimulated a wave of new donations and 22,000 items had been acquired by 1877. Over the subsequent decades, the collection continued to develop into new areas. This was encouraged and facilitated by both the physical expansion of the museum (including the development of new branch sites) and the development of new academic areas of interest.</p>
<p>The establishment of an art gallery, to complement the museum, was first suggested at a meeting of the School of Art Committee and Fine Art Section of the Leicester Literary &amp; Philosophical Society in January 1880. An Art Gallery Committee was set up and well over E2,000 collected by 1881. A permanent gallery to show these works (using an extension of the museum built as a lecture hall) was opened in 1885.</p>
<p>While geology, botany, zoology, Egyptology, archaeology and (to a lesser extent) art were collected by the museum from 1849 onwards, science and industry and decorative arts were only recognised as separate disciplines in the 1950s and &#8217;60s. By this time social history (including costume) had also emerged as a subject in its own right, although in Leicester it remained closely associated with archaeology until 1980.</p>
<p>The museum&#8217;s historical ethnography collections were largely disposed of after the Second World War as a decision was made to focus more on local and national collections. Some items, including an Egyptian mummy, went to Liverpool Museum which had suffered large losses to its ethnographic collections due to bombing raids during the War. However, this proved to be a short-sighted decision as mass immigration from the 1960s and &#8217;70s made Leicester one of the most diverse cities in the country. The need to collect material that in some way reflected this diversity of heritage and geographic origin led to the establishment of what we now call World Cultures (i.e. art, craft, design and material culture from all around the World, particularly the Americas, Asia, Africa and Oceania) as a separate subject area from the late 1970s/earIy 1980s. This has raised important questions about traditional ways of defining collections which remain problematic and subject to continuing debate both within and without the service.</p>
<p>Archaeology and biology are the largest collections, comprising hundreds of thousands of items each, mainly collected through fieldwork and excavations. Until the 1990s the service included a Field Archaeology Unit (now part of the University of Leicester) and the County&#8217;s Biological Records Service. Industrial history is another substantial collection, reflecting a process of rapid economic change in the industrial landscape during the 1960s, &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s.</p>
<p>The collections have been developed through gifts, loans and purchases. Most items have been given, but some collections, especially art, have been built up with significant numbers of purchases. The City of Leicester Museums Trust supports Leicester Museums and Galleries through the purchase of items for the collections.</p>
<p>The Service went through a dramatic change in 1973/74 when, as a part of local government reorganisation, the city museums were incorporated into what became known as Leicestershire Museums, Arts and Records Service. From this time, defined collections policies began to be established.</p>
<p>In 1997 local government was reorganised again and Leicester became a Unitary Authority independent of the county. Three services were created from Leicestershire Museums, Arts and Records Service and the collections were reviewed to identify which authority should be responsible for which collection. The Determination of the Destination of Museum Collections report was approved by: Leicester City Council Arts and Leisure Committee (9 Nov 98), Leicestershire County Council Arts Libraries and Museums Committee (8 Jan 99) and Rutland County Council (18 Jan 99).</p>
<p>In essence, the collections division followed three principles:</p>
<p>Collections with strong provenance to either the city or county were allocated accordingly;</p>
<p>Some collections were allocated by theme i.e. standard gauge railways were made the responsibility of the county, with narrow gauge becoming part of the city collections. These allocations tended to follow the available curatorial expertise within each service at the time.</p>
<p>Existing displays were not dismantled and, in most cases, objects on display in one location but allocated to a different service were made loans.</p>
<p>In practice, the County transferred from the City items with greatest relevance to them, and for which the standard of cataloguing was sufficiently good for this to be judged. The City continued to hold the remaining (majority) of the collections. Since the original agreement and initial large-scale transfers, transfers of individual items or collections have continued, e.g. a number of items from the Snibston Discovery Museum were transferred to the city after the site&#8217;s closure by Leicestershire County Council in 2015.</p>

				     	<p>In the 1940s the Gayer-Anderson twin brothers determined to pass Little Hall and a collection of objects to Surrey County Council in order to establish the Gayer-Anderson Hostel for Art Students. On the death of Colonel Thomas Gayer-Anderson in 1960 this duly happened. The will restricted how the bequest could be passed on if the Council no longer had a use. In accordance with these terms the collection was passed to the Suffolk Building Preservation Trust in 1973 who opened Little Hall as a museum the following year. Since then there have been a few acquisitions associated with the history of the building and its occupants, in accordance with the collection policy.</p>

				     	<p>The museum was started by ex-servicemen in the 1980s. A large number of objects were collected in a short space of time, paperwork and recording was poor and the difference between ‘loan&#8217; and ‘gift&#8217; not properly understood by many of the donors. A number of attempts were made to catalogue the collection and finally it was computerised. A trawl was made of all existing paperwork and the information recorded on the computerised catalogue.</p>
<p>Part of the collection, the Yeomanry Room, had developed separately from the rest of the museum and at the end of 2012 it was decided to incorporate it into the rest of the collection. All relevant parties agreed the only condition was that any disposal of Leicestershire Yeomanry memorabilia be offered to the Leicestershire and Derbyshire Squadron of the Royal Yeomanry (the unit) first.</p>

				     	<p>The Museum has created its collection from a zero base and has been actively collecting items since 2006. The collection has been created and shaped by the Cardiff community: being integral to the decisions made about <em>what</em> the new museum of Cardiff would interpret and collect, and then in <em>how</em> that collection was created. The Museum actively sourced objects, initially concentrating on items that would help tell the stories planned for its phase 1 galleries for immediate display. It proactively communicated with museums across the UK to determine suitable objects for transfer, approached and discussed with organisations, businesses and community groups, identifying objects to represent their stories and worked with the local media to encourage discussion and donations. On occasion it has purchased items for the collection, but this has usually been grant aided. This proactive approach to collecting continues. Collecting is built into all Museum activity and forms a key part of its projects with community partners. Since the Museum&#8217;s opening in 2011, collecting has been widened to focus on all aspects of Cardiff&#8217;s history.</p>

				     	<p>From 1988 objects were gathered together by Kirsten Hardie, from the Cultural and Historical Studies department of the then Bournemouth and Poole College of Art and Design as a teaching and learning resource. Initially these objects had a graphic design focus and were known as the Design Archive.</p>
<p>By 2001 the collection had grown sufficiently, with additions contributed by other members of staff, for it to become a Registered museum entitled the Design Collection Museum.</p>
<p>2003 saw a successful AHRB bid for funding to develop a project under the title ‘Plastics network&#8217;.</p>
<p>A review of the collection was carried out in 2006. This review demonstrated that there was considerable strength in objects made of plastics. As such, the decision was taken to focus on the plastics materials group.</p>
<p>On 1 September 2007 the name of the museum became the Museum of Design in Plastics (MoDiP). At the same time the term ‘Studio Collection&#8217; was coined to describe the objects excluded from the Plastics Collection, mainly objects not made of plastics.</p>
<p>To strengthen the focus of the museum towards the Plastics Collection, a rationalisation programme was started in 2015. This programme will see the Studio Collection disposed in line with section 5 of this policy.</p>
<p>This strengthening of the Plastics Collection has seen the fulfilment of the museum&#8217;s ambition be awarded Designated Outstanding Collection status by Arts Council England.</p>

				     	<p>The Museum&#8217;s Collection is the world&#8217;s largest, and most significant, accumulation of artefacts relating the British Army and other Land Forces of the British Crown (including the former Indian Army until 1947). The Collection consists of over one million items, spanning a 600-year period with particular depth and strength for the period c1780-1914. Its geographical remit extends to all parts of the world where British land forces have fought or been stationed.</p>
<p>Although the Museum received its Royal Charter (159KB) on 8 April 1960, the origins of the institution go back to the years just after the Second World War. The amalgamation of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, brought together at Sandhurst a collection of historical items around which a Royal Military Academy Museum was formed. There was an existing network of regimental and corps museums, but it was identified that there was a need to provide a repository for items relating to the pre-1947 Indian Army, the Irish regiments disbanded in 1922, and cavalry regiments which lacked depots at which they could form museums. Appeals for exhibits were published in the newspapers in 1948 and subsequent years, and in late 1949 the Indian Army Memorial Room was opened; followed by cavalry and Irish regiment displays in 1951. By 1958, with thousands of items in a rapidly growing collection, it was felt that then separate collections of Indian, Irish and cavalry relics should be brought together into a single National Army Museum. In 1960 the Royal Charter (159KB) was obtained, and Her Majesty the Queen opened new permanent displays in the former Riding School at Sandhurst on 15 July 1960.</p>
<p>The collections continued to rapidly expand in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1963 the Museum acquired large proportions of the collections held by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). In 1971, the first phase of the current museum building was opened in Chelsea, London, providing additional storage and display facilities. In the early 1980s the NAM&#8217;s collecting remit was extended to the First and Second World War and beyond. In the 1990s and 2000s a number of major collections were acquired. These included the collections of the Buffs; the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes; the Women&#8217;s Royal Army Corps; Royal Army Education Corps; the Museum of Army Transport; the Middlesex Regiment; the reference collection of the Army Museums Ogilby Trust; and books from the War Office Library. In 1991 the Soldiers Effects Records were transferred from the National Archives, and in 1999 over 20,000 sealed patterns were acquired from the Ministry of Defence.</p>
<p>In the first decade of the 21st century the Museum focused more on collecting contemporary material relating to the then current operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, whilst continuing to augment its older material. In 2013 the Museum acquired the Field Marshal Sir John Lyon Chapple Indian Army Collection of badges and insignia. The Grenadier Guards Archive was transferred to the Museum in 2016 and the Coldstream Guards Archive in 2019. The Museum has also started to rationalise its Collection, focusing on the review of duplicate items, non-military badges and buttons, and vehicles outside its core collecting remit.</p>

				     	<p>The collection of uniform includes over 80,000 items of uniform and other garments dating from the mid-seventeenth century to the present day. Collectively this constitutes one of the world&#8217;s largest collections of occupational costume.</p>
<p>The collection of fine and decorative art embraces pictorial works of art, together with three-dimensional arts and crafts such as sculpture, ceramics and silver. The collection includes ethnographic and soldier-made craft objects, as well as jewellery and mess ware. In total the collection comprises some 50,000 works on paper, over 700 oil paintings, 1,500 items of silver and 1,600 ceramics.</p>
<p>The collection of medals and badges includes over 20,000 individual medals including 39 Victoria Crosses, and around 50,000 badges and other insignia.</p>
<p>The collection of colours, guidons and flags numbers nearly 1,200 items, including very rare examples from the English Civil Wars (1642-49), and French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars of 1783-1815.</p>
<p>The collection of weapons covers those used by the British soldier from the age of the longbow to the present day, and includes around 2,400 edged weapons, over 250 polearms, and over 1,700 firearms. A small representative collection of Artillery is also included in this category.</p>
<p>The collection of equipment includes in excess of 16,000 items of personal equipment, scientific instruments, models and dioramas, medical equipment, musical instruments, armour and horse furniture.</p>
<p>The vehicle collection numbers around 40 items, ranging from motorcycles and armoured vehicles to large trucks and primarily relates around the theme of transport and logistics.</p>
<p>The Museum&#8217;s collection of archives, photographs, film and sound contains tens of thousands of private, regimental and business papers illustrating more than five centuries of British military history. The photographic collection comprises an estimated 500,000 images dating from the 1840s to the present day. The film collection is composed mainly of unofficial footage taken by soldiers and their families from the 1930s onwards. The sound collection holds recordings (dating from the 1920s onwards) of British Army and military bands, and over 750 oral history recordings. The Museum holds archival material including documents, sound recordings, photographs and film in both physical and digital formats. It is also a Place of Deposit for Public Records. The Museum maintains a separate Institutional Archive.</p>
<p>The collection of printed books is the largest in its field readily accessible to the general public. The library administers over 58,000 volumes published since the early sixteenth century, which include extensive holdings of regimental histories, campaign histories, biographies, Army Lists and other official publications. In addition, the Museum holds over 1000 periodical titles. The Museum provides access to a number of online resources through the Templer Study Centre such as JSTOR and Ancestry.</p>
<p>The collections include small numbers of items relating to foreign armies used for comparative purposes. The Museum will continue to collect material relating to foreign armies with a clear comparative role and high potential for display and/or research.</p>
<p>The Museum also holds a handling collection managed by the Learning Department. Although the items belong to the Council of the National Army Museum, they are not bound by this Policy.</p>

				     	<h2>Main Collection</h2>
<p>The collection started with the purchase of 38 paintings from the collection of John Julius Angerstein, which included both historical Continental works as well as representative paintings from the British School and even a work by a then living painter, Sir David Wilkie. At the start, there was no established annual purchase grant, so the growth of the collection was heavily reliant on gifts and bequests, which began with the Beaumont Gift in 1826 and the Holwell Carr Bequest in 1831. After 1855, when the Gallery&#8217;s management was reconstituted, a new annual purchasing grant was established, and a policy instituted which envisioned the Gallery becoming the national repository of Western European art from its origins in the mid-13th century. This remained the case until 2014, when the Gallery acquired its first American painting, at which point the Gallery&#8217;s strapline changed to indicate that it was a Gallery of paintings in the Western European tradition,</p>
<h2>Contextual Collection</h2>
<p>The Contextual Collection was formed in 2008, in order to exercise appropriate care for works of art owned by the Gallery, but which were not considered to be part of the normal collecting remit of the main/National Collection. These included works which illuminated and celebrated the history of the Gallery. This was called the &#8216;History&#8217; collection but was renamed the &#8216;Contextual Collection&#8217; in 2023, to reflect the broader range of objects in the collection, for example, those by associate artists.</p>
<h2>Library Collection</h2>
<p>The Library was established in 1870 with the purchase of the private library of some 2,000 volumes belonging to the late Sir Charles Eastlake, the first Director of the National Gallery.</p>

				     	<h2>Main Collection</h2>
<p>The National Gallery houses the national collection of painting in the Western European tradition, spanning the period from the thirteenth to the early twentieth centuries. The Gallery aims to tell the story of painting in the Western European tradition as completely as possible and at the highest possible level.</p>
<p>The collection includes masterpieces such as Van Eyck&#8217;s Arnolfini Portrait, Piero della Francesca&#8217;s The Baptism of Christ, Holbein&#8217;s Ambassadors, Leonardo&#8217;s Virgin of the Rocks, Vermeer&#8217;s Young Woman Standing at a Virginal, Velazquez&#8217;s Rokeby Venus, Turner&#8217;s Fighting Temeraire and Van Gogh&#8217;s Sunflowers. The work of some of the greatest painters, for example Raphael, Titian, Rembrandt, Rubens, Poussin, Monet and Cezanne, is represented in great depth, with a range of works of varying types and from different periods of the artists&#8217; careers.</p>
<p>The National Gallery is also custodian to the following collections, which are distinctly separate from the National Collection. The works in these collections are not subject to the constraints of the Gallery and Galleries Act 1992.</p>
<p>Collection development for the Library and Archive is supported by policies required for Archive Service Accreditation.</p>
<h2>Contextual Collection</h2>
<p>The National Gallery&#8217;s Contextual Collection consists of works of art and objects, acquired by the Gallery since its foundation, which illuminate the history of the Gallery, its buildings, its collection and its relationship with contemporary artists.</p>
<p>The Contextual Collection includes portraits of former National Gallery staff, directors, trustees and benefactors; depictions of the Gallery&#8217;s buildings and their interiors at different periods; internal and external architectural sculpture and mosaics forming part of the Gallery&#8217;s fabric; and furniture and objects that have a significant connection to the Gallery. It also includes commissions, works of art by contemporary artists, including Artists in Residence or Associate Artists, as well as other artists whose work has been the subject of temporary exhibitions at the National Gallery, or who have worked directly from the collection.</p>
<h2>Frame Collection</h2>
<p>The Gallery consists of approximately 3,000 frames, including original frames acquired with certain paintings, antique frames subsequently acquired to frame Gallery paintings, and reproduction frames, either produced at the Gallery or externally at various moments.</p>
<h2>Library Collection</h2>
<p>The Library contains around 100,000 printed volumes relevant to the study of the history of paintings in the Western European tradition from the 13th to the early 20th century. The Library&#8217;s holdings include monographs, catalogues raisonnes, exhibition catalogues, and pamphlets; works on iconography; permanent collection catalogues from the National Gallery and important galleries throughout the world; a fine collection of publications relating to private collections in this country and abroad; a significant collection of early guidebooks; a strong collection of early source works consisting of approximately 2,000 titles published before 1850; catalogues of picture sales from major auction houses and reasonably complete runs of the catalogues of certain commercial dealers; over 250 periodical titles, of which 150 are current.</p>
<h2>Archive Collection</h2>
<p>The National Gallery Archive holds records generated by the Gallery, from its establishment in 1824, in the course of its business. These records are Public Records, and the Archive is recognised as a Place of Deposit by the National Archives. Gallery records are selected for permanent preservation due to their evidential, informational or historical value, in line with the Public Records Acts of 1958 and 1967, and National Archives&#8217; standards.</p>
<p>The Archive holds records from individuals and corporate bodies, where they have a particular relevance to the history of the Gallery, its Collection, or the history of collecting European paintings. This includes the private papers of staff, trustees, collectors and academics, or papers relating to pictures in the Gallery&#8217;s Collection.</p>
<p>The management of the Archive is guided by the Code of Practice on Archives for Museums and Galleries in the United Kingdom (third edition, 2002). The Archive Development Plan and Policy are managed separately to this policy through the Archive Service Accreditation.</p>

				     	<p>The basis of the collection of the National Museum of the Royal Navy is formed from the legacy collections of National Museum&#8217;s founder Museums and historic ship trusts including: Royal Naval Museum, Royal Marines Museum, Royal Navy Submarine Museum, Explosion Museum of Naval Firepower, Fleet Air Arm Museum, HMS Warrior Preservation Trust and HMS Trincomalee Trust. Histories for each of these are as follows:</p>
<h2>Royal Naval Museum</h2>
<p>The origins of these collections are in the Dockyard Museum (established in 1911) and the Victory Museum (established in 1938). These collections were amalgamated at the creation of the Royal Naval Museum in 1972 and were developed significantly by bequest, gift, purchase, transfer or loan with items relating to the history of the Royal Navy, and its people, throughout the area of its worldwide operations. The Royal Naval Museum Trust was established in February 2010 as a linked charity of the National Museum of the Royal Navy, its sole corporate trustee. The Royal Naval Museum Portsmouth is now fully integrated within the National Museum of the Royal Navy. On 30 November 2016, the operational activities of the museum transferred to a newly incorporated charitable entity, NMRN Operations, a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Museum of the Royal Navy.</p>
<h2>Royal Marines Museum</h2>
<p>The collections were based on artefacts from the Corps messes at Chatham, Portsmouth (Eastney) and Plymouth. These barracks took in historical objects throughout their lives, with particular weight given to medals and uniforms. These were expanded following the formation of the Museum in 1958.<strong> </strong>The Royal Marines Museum Trust was established in June 1969. On 22 March 2018, the National Museum of the Royal Navy was appointed as its sole corporate Trustee and the Trust is now fully integrated into the National Museum.</p>
<h2>Royal Navy Submarine Museum</h2>
<p>The Royal Navy Submarine Museum was created at HMS Dolphin in 1963, was formally recognised by the Ministry of Defence in 1967, and became a charity in 1970. In 1978 the Museum moved out of the naval establishment, providing full access to members of the public for the first time. The collection centres around three historic boats (Holland 1, X24 and HMS Alliance), and was then expanded to cover all aspects of the history of Royal Navy submarines. The Royal Naval Submarine Trust was established in August 2016, with the National Museum of the Royal Navy as its sole corporate Trustee.</p>
<h2>Fleet Air Arm Museum</h2>
<p>The Fleet Air Arm Museum was established on 28 May 1964 and the Fleet Air Arm Museum Charitable Trust was subsequently established in June 1966. The Fleet Air Arm collection developed to cover the history of the Royal Naval Air Service and Fleet Air Arm from inception to the present day. On 26 January 2017, the National Museum of the Royal Navy was appointed as its sole corporate Trustee.</p>
<h2>Explosion The Museum of Naval Firepower</h2>
<p>The museum opened as the Museum of Naval Ordnance on 10 December 1971. The collection was made up of those gathered together from Old Gunwharf, Portsmouth and Upnor Castle adding them to loans from other National Museums such as Greenwich. On 30 April 2001 it was transformed into a trust and opened as Explosion The Museum of Naval Firepower before transferring to Gosport Borough Council the following year. Ownership again changed to the Portsmouth Naval Base Property Trust in 2009 and then to the National Museum of the Royal Navy in April 2013.</p>
<h2>HMS Warrior Preservation Trust</h2>
<p>The Warrior Preservation Trust Limited (the company) was established on 9 July 1968.</p>
<p>The Maritime Trust obtained the hulk of HMS WARRIOR 1860 from the MoD in 1979 for the sum of £1. The ship was restored in Hartlepool from 1979-1987. Ownership was transferred in 1983 to the Ships Preservation Trust (which was subsumed into the Warrior Preservation Trust in 1985). From 1987 the shares of the Warrior Preservation Trust were owned by the Manifold Trust. The share-holding passed to the Directors of the Warrior Preservation Trust in 2010.</p>
<p>Since 1987, the ship has been on display to the public in Portsmouth Naval Base as part of the historic dockyard.</p>
<p>On 1 July 2017, the Warrior Preservation Trust Limited transferred all of its operational activities to NMRN Operations, a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Museum of the Royal Navy. A small collection of material was created to support the history, understanding and display of the ship, as well as document her restoration. The collection was reviewed and rationalised at this time to remove duplication and display collections, and assure the establishment of a core collection of material reflecting HMS Warrior&#8217;s history and restoration which was digitised and made available for public use.</p>
<h2>HMS Trincomalee Trust</h2>
<p>HMS Trincomalee was renamed HMS Foudroyant in the early 1900s. However, when The HMS Trincomalee Trust was formed in January 1992, she reverted to her original name. The ship was restored in Hartlepool shortly after HMS Warrior had left and opened to visitors by the Trust as a museum ship in 2000. In June 2014 HMS Trincomalee Trust became a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Museum of the Royal Navy. In June 2016 the Museum took responsibility for HMS Trincomalee and the site previously known as Hartlepool Historic Quay where she is docked, along with a small collection of objects and a large archive pertaining to the ship&#8217;s restoration (the archive being on deposit at Teesside University&#8217;s Library and Archive facility).</p>
<h2>HMS Caroline</h2>
<p>HMS Caroline acted as a Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve ship for many years after the Second World War. She was formally decommissioned in 2011. HMS Caroline Preservation Trust was established in November 2012 as a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Museum of the Royal Navy which is the sole corporate member of the company. The charity is the sole corporate Trustee of the HMS Caroline Preservation Trust. The Ship, the collection and the endowment for the future of HMS Caroline are held under the objects of this Trust. All operational activity is undertaken under an operator agreement with the charitable entity, NMRN Operations also a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Museum, to enable both the maintenance of the Ship and its present it as a visitor attraction to the public as part of its charitable activities. Material to support her restoration, history and display have since been collected directly into the Museum.</p>
<h2>HMS Victory</h2>
<p>HMS Victory Preservation Company was established in February 2012 as a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Museum of the Royal Navy which is the sole corporate member of the company. On 29 March 2012, the ownership of HMS Victory transferred to the HMS Victory Preservation Trust, an unincorporated registered charitable trust of the company. An agreement was signed which allows the use of the Ship by the Royal Navy for the foreseeable future. HMS Victory thus remains a commissioned warship and the Royal Navy&#8217;s Flagship.</p>
<h2>National Museum of the Royal Navy</h2>
<p>Since 2016 the collection has been seen as one single national collection held by the Museum and is the single collecting body.</p>

			     	<div class="collection-record__content">
				     	<p>The collection covers items of significance and scale, such as ships, boats and aircraft and airframes and both display and reserve material comprising books, documentary archives, photographs, film and sound material, artefacts (such as textiles, models, medals, operational and personal equipment and weapons), artwork (including paintings, print and sculpture) and, most recently, maritime archaeology. Broad areas of the collection are set out as follows:</p>
<h2>Ships</h2>
<p>There are 10 historic ships managed by the National Museum of the Royal Navy that are of international significance and are recognised by National Historic Ships as part of the National Historic Fleet (NHF):</p>
<ul>
<li>HMS Victory (1765) – world&#8217;s only surviving first rate ship-of-the-line</li>
<li>HMS Trincomalee (1817) – fifth rate frigate</li>
<li>HMS Warrior (1860) – ironclad steam frigate</li>
<li>Holland 1 (1901) – Royal Navy&#8217;s first submarine</li>
<li>Steam Pinnace 199 (1911) – pinnace</li>
<li>HMS Caroline (1914) – light cruiser</li>
<li>HMS M.33 (1915) – monitor</li>
<li>H21 (1918) – sea-plane lighter</li>
<li>LCT 7074 (1944) – landing craft</li>
<li>HMS Alliance (1945) – submarine</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also 4 historic ships, recognised as part of the National Register of Historic Ships:</p>
<ul>
<li>MTB 71 (1940) – motor torpedo boat</li>
<li>CMB 331 (1941) – coastal motorboat (Registered as MTB 331)</li>
<li>RML 497 (1941 – Fairmile B Rescue Motor Launch)</li>
<li>X24 (1943) – midget submarine</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other historic boats held by NMRN. These are all too small or too recently built to be recognised by the National Register of Historic Ships:</p>
<ul>
<li>King Charles II&#8217;s state barge (c.1660) – used at Vice-Admiral Lord Nelson&#8217;s funeral</li>
<li>Maiale (1943) – human torpedo</li>
<li>Biber 105 (1944) – human torpedo</li>
<li>X51 (1954) – midget submarine</li>
<li>LCVP F7 (1965) – landing craft</li>
<li>Rigid Raider Craft Mk1 – Royal Marine patrol boat</li>
</ul>
<p>Our collection also includes canoes, cockle boats and folboats (folding kayaks). These ships and boats are often accompanied by significant collections of historic artefacts and archives as well as the records of their conservation and restoration.</p>
<p>The nature of the care and maintenance of historic ships and boats means that material such as timbers, or parts of timbers, are occasionally needed to be removed following a heritage impact assessment (HIA). More details around the management of these ‘arisings&#8217;.</p>
<h2>Aircraft</h2>
<p>The aircraft and airframe collection is a key component of the NMRN collection and is regarded as a collection of national importance. Comprising over 100 complete or incomplete airframes, there are 18 that would be regarded as unique or highly significant.</p>
<p>Other material included in this area are over 80 aircraft engines and over 10,000 items of aircraft parts and equipment, maintenance tools and specialist equipment.</p>
<p>The collection is particularly strong in aircraft from the 1940s to the 1960s, but has a good representation of the entire history of the Royal Naval Air Service and Fleet Air Arm. While there are specific gaps in aircraft type (demonstrated by the existence of the Barracuda Project) the collection of new aircraft is a low priority with airframes only being considered if an element of uniqueness through provenance and story can be identified.</p>
<h2>Archives</h2>
<p>The archive collections consist mainly of documentary and photographic archival material with a smaller collection of film and sound material.</p>
<h3>Documentary archive</h3>
<p>The documentary archive contains various types of material including but not limited to: diaries, letters, log books, certificates, line books, maps, reports, flying logs, technical drawings and plans, posters, reports, broadsides, etc.</p>
<p>This part of the collection has mainly been created through personal donations with some purchases. It covers all aspects of the history of the Royal Navy, but is particularly strong in the 19<sup>th</sup> and early part of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Topics include but are not limited to: sailing navy, personal accounts, Fleet Air Arm, Falklands Conflict, World Wars, Interwar period, Women&#8217;s Royal Naval Service (WRNS), Naval Communications Branch, armaments, personnel papers including Enlistment and Attestation papers, Muster Lists and Rating records. The recent acquisition of the 10 Armada Maps has been a significant addition to the documentary&#8217;s beginning to strengthening the material available on the early navy.</p>
<p>Official documentation and reports from the Royal Navy are on occasion collected through the DBS Records Reviewers when it is not required by The National Archives. The Fleet Air Arm Museum is also an appointed Place of Deposit by The National Archive to hold ADM 335: a collection of papers known as The State of The Art, drawn together by the Admiralty. Place of Deposit is to be extended across the NMRN in the near future so the Priddy&#8217;s Hard collection currently held at the Hampshire Record Office can be transferred.</p>
<p>Corporate archive material is accepted into the documentary archive as appropriate. In particular, archives around the management and preservation of our historic ships are prioritised in order to better inform future preservation activities. Other material is accepted in order to create a representative picture of the history and identity of the organisation.</p>
<h3>Photographic archive</h3>
<p>The photographic collections at the National Museum of the Royal Navy are extensive, including over 2,000,000 individual images. These range in format from early Victorian daguerreotypes and ambrotypes to recent digital prints, though the majority of the collection is photographic prints and negatives (film and glass plate). The vast bulk of the collection covers the 20<sup>th</sup> century, including large photographic album collections for this period. Like the documentary archive much of these collections have been compiled from personal donation but some large collections of official Naval photography and from named photographers, such as Wright &amp; Logan, Bruce-Leslie, etc., exist. In particular, RN ships&#8217; portraits are comprehensive.</p>
<h3>Film and sound archive</h3>
<p>The film and sound archive contains a broad range of material types, including a significant collection of around 400 oral history recordings. This part of the collection has a particularly strong focus on the Second World War period of the Surface Navy, and the Royal Marines from 1990 to 2010. Some key areas covered include, the WRNS, the Battle of the Atlantic, the Gulf War and Afghanistan. Other parts of the sound collection include recordings of the Royal Marines and other Naval bands. Various formats for the sound collection exist including reel to reel, cassette, vinyl, mini disc, CD, mp3, etc.</p>
<p>The film collection is located separately with part of it being held at the Wessex Film and Sound Archive, and the rest being stored at the Fleet Air Arm Museum. It contains various format types including reel to reel and VHS, and covers many topics including personal footage from service, newsreel footage, and training videos made by the Royal Navy among other things.</p>
<h2>Art</h2>
<p>The Art collections across the NMRN cover a wide variety of styles and techniques. We hold around 4,500 paintings, drawings and prints, which cover the late 17<sup>th</sup> century through to the present day. The variety of the subject matter is extensive including, portraiture of people as well as ships, submarines or aircraft, caricatures, detailed uniform studies, depictions of naval actions, operations or places visited by naval personnel.</p>
<p>In 2017 the Museum took ownership of a significant proportion of the former Ministry of Defence Art Collection (MODAC) comprising nearly 700 pieces of predominately fine art and sculpture items but also examples of tableware and furniture. Much of this material is presently on loan, but this situation is expected to change over time.</p>
<h2>Artefacts</h2>
<p>The artefact collections contain a diverse and wide range of material, which includes ships&#8217; fittings, operational equipment and uniform items together with personal items used, made or acquired by naval personnel during their service. In addition, we have material commemorating naval events or people. Greater emphasis is given to the acquisition of items that have provenance to identified personnel, ships, boats, aircraft or events rather than on the collection of typographical items with no known association. Significant collections types include:</p>
<h3>Medals</h3>
<p>This is one of the largest and most comprehensive collections of Royal Navy medals in the world, with over 15,000 individual pieces, and includes examples of almost every type of medal awarded to members of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines. There is a high proportion of gallantry awards and a significant variety of foreign awards to members of the Royal Navy. Included in the collection are a number of early, privately minted examples, such as Boulton&#8217;s Nile and Trafalgar medals, pre-dating the first medals officially produced by the Royal Navy.</p>
<h3>Models</h3>
<p>There is an extensive collection of over 750 individual ship models, which includes surface ships, landing craft and submarines. We also hold models of aircraft, instructional models of weapons and missile systems as well as dioramas of naval operations. The models are of various different types, ranging from high quality builders&#8217; models to entirely bespoke home-made examples.</p>
<h3>Ships&#8217; fittings and decorations</h3>
<p>The NMRN has a nationally important collection of 87 figureheads ranging between the 18<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. Significant examples include those from HMS Victory and HMS Trincomalee, unusual in having belonged to surviving ships, both of which are part of the NMRN collection themselves. Other figureheads of note include two which were carved in India for Royal Navy ships built at the Honourable East India Company&#8217;s yard.</p>
<p>NMRN also has a substantial collection of over 5,000 nameboards, crests, honours&#8217; boards, tompions, treadplates, plaques, and bells primarily from post-1900 ships, submarines and naval air stations.</p>
<p>The collection also contains some examples of furniture carried on ships and boats, or souvenir items carved from reclaimed ships&#8217; timber.</p>
<h3>Textile and clothing</h3>
<p>The NMRN has extensive uniform collection numbering over 15,000 items including some that are considered of national significance. Key items include rare examples of eighteenth- century uniform, such as a bearskin mitre cap from the American War of Independence era or the Royal Marines coat dating from around 1800 recently purchased from the Kochan collection. The collections are strongest in post-Second World War period, with many Sealed Patterns acquired from the Defence Clothing and Textile Agency (DCTA) including examples of working dress, formal dress uniforms and a comprehensive collection of headwear and badges across all branches of the Royal Navy.</p>
<p>In addition, we hold examples of clothing that are not formerly recorded as uniform but have become perceived in this way over time for example, the Pirate Rig worn by submariners when at sea.</p>
<p>We also collect examples of non-naval clothing when there has a strong link to the Royal Navy. Examples include sport caps, the nightdress made of a naval ensign or the ballet shoes belonging to HMS Tiptoe.</p>
<p>The museum has a good collection of flags representing all aspects of the Royal Navy dating predominately from the twentieth century. Among the collection are official flags, including ensigns flown by ships during battles, commissioning and decommissioning pennants, Royal Marine Colours as well as flags captured from enemy forces during battle including examples from the Seven Years War, China Wars, First and Second World Wars. We also collect unofficial flags and have a significant collection of Jolly Rogers.</p>
<h3>Personal, mess and commemorative items</h3>
<p>We hold substantial collections of personal items, predominately dating from the 20<sup>th</sup> century period. These collections encompass a wide variety of items from ditty boxes to items of jewellery such as the Rolex watch purchased by a Prisoner of War. They also feature good examples of craft, embroidery and artwork produced by sailors as well as examples of items exchanged between sailors and their families.</p>
<p>We have significant collections of former mess property, including presentation and commemorative pieces, mess silver and tableware, dating from the 18<sup>th</sup> century. In addition, we also hold more unusual items relating to communal ships&#8217; activities such as items relating to crossing the line ceremonies or stuffed ships&#8217; pets.</p>
<p>The museum collections also contain many examples of items collected by naval personnel during their service from around the world. Many have been gifted, bought or traded but the museum recognises that some of these items, such as the Edo altar tusk from the Benin expedition of 1897, and a set of Chinese vases from the Yuanmingyuan, or Imperial Chinese Palace, burned and looted in 1860 were stolen from their indigenous communities. Other items have poor provenance and currently little is known about their acquisition. In these instances, more work is required to work with representatives from the descendant community groups to improve our understanding, cataloguing and interpretation of our holdings and, in some cases, this may result in the repatriation or restitution of material to the source communities.</p>
<h3>Operational equipment</h3>
<p>This large category reflects the broad range of occupations undertaken by naval personnel over centuries.</p>
<p>One of the most substantial collections of material relates to radio, communications and navigational equipment used by the navy during the twentieth century and collected by HMS Collingwood. In addition, we have good collections of optical equipment including periscopes, telescopes and binoculars as well as optical testing equipment.</p>
<p>We have a significant collection of musical instruments primarily relating to the Royal Marine Band Service. Notable examples include instruments that were damaged during the IRA bombing of Deal Barracks and the Battle of Jutland.</p>
<p>The work of the Coastal Forces branch, is strongly represented reflecting the history of the branch from its inception in the First World War to 1957. Other branches or trades are less comprehensively represented but we hold examples of equipment used by divers, medical services as well as survival and Safety Equipment. In addition, we have collected a variety of hand tools from shipwright tools and aircraft engineering equipment, to issued tools, such as entrenching tools, and tools for working on weaponry and armaments.</p>
<h3>Human remains</h3>
<p>The Museum collection includes a very small number of items recognised as human remains under the terms of the Human Tissue Act 2004. Our existing holdings are all over 100 years old and it is not our intention to actively collect further in this area.</p>
<h2>Library</h2>
<p>The NMRN library covers all aspects of the history of the Royal Navy including specialist collections covering the Royal Marines, Royal Naval Air Service, Fleet Air Arm, Submarines and naval communications. It contains material covering the 16<sup>th</sup>-21<sup>st</sup> centuries and is approximately 25,000 items.</p>
<p>The collection is particularly strong in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biographical material</li>
<li>Operational history</li>
<li>Technology, with an exceptional focus on radio and radar</li>
<li>Naval and Royal Marines regulations</li>
</ul>
<p>It holds a number of specialist periodicals including Navy Lists from 1797 and Admiralty Fleet Orders. As well as a number of rare books and privately published works. From an initial identification of only 22 rare items; this collection has more than doubled at the Portsmouth site following a dedicated review of the Royal Marines Library. The following examples are globally rare, with no other surviving copies being traced during the relocation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Guns of HMS Warrior 1861 – 1864 by Ernest F Slaymaker</li>
<li>Hints to Young Marine Officers on their Duties Afloat / By Lieutenant J. Urquhart. &#8211; [s.l.] : James Burrill, 1842.</li>
<li>Memorandum on the Power of Russia to operate against Northern Afghanistan: Prepared in the Intelligence Branch; with a note on the military and political situation on the Hindu Kush Frontier and a brief strategical report on the Eastern Hindu Kush / By Captain J A Douglas, DAQMG Quarter Master generals Department. &#8211; [s.l.] : Government Printing Office, 1899</li>
</ul>
<p>Core elements of the catalogue are available to the public online through the NMRN Collections portal and through JISC Library Hub.</p>
<h2>Maritime archaeology</h2>
<p>The National Museum of the Royal Navy has a nationally significant and expanding collection of maritime archaeological material.</p>
<p>All acquisitions of archaeological material recovered from Royal Navy ships are subject to the approval of the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and The Receiver of Wrecks and the National Museum of the Royal Navy liaises closely with both parties to ensure the preservation of significant maritime archaeological items. On occasion we are offered material after it has been seized following illegal recovery, such as with the bell from HMS Prince of Wales.</p>
<p>In exceptional circumstances the MOD will grant permission for the recovery items from a Royal Navy wreck site. In these cases, we often work with other partners to recover the items which are then presented to the museum. Significant recent examples include a project working with National Grid and Wessex Archaeology to recover sections of a Barracuda lost in the Solent. We have also acquired over 8,000 items recovered from wreck of HMS Invincible which sank in 1758.</p>
<h2>Weapons</h2>
<p>The museum has a nationally significant collection of firearms and edged weapons, many of which were recently acquired from the collection of Sim Comfort. The collection includes some rare and well provenanced items including Captain Broke&#8217;s fighting sword which he used when he and the crew of HMS Shannon boarded and took USS Chesapeake.</p>
<p>We also have a comprehensive collection of naval guns, larger weapons, specialist weapons, as well as a substantial collection of torpedoes and missiles, depth charges including numerous parts of weapons, shell cases, fuses and primers. The main focus is from the 18th century to the Second World War with some examples from the Falklands conflict and the Gulf War.</p>

				     	<p>National Museums NI was established as National Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland under the Museums and Galleries (Northern Ireland) Order 1998. It comprises four museums that were founded at different times and for different purposes. The summaries below are indicative, rather than comprehensive.</p>
<p>The national collection has been almost 200 years in the making. It is an amalgam of institutional histories and the passions of generations of curators, scholars and enthusiasts. Although the thinking about collecting and collections has evolved over time (and continues to evolve), the creation of the national collection has always been fundamentally driven by the desire to record and preserve what is important about the world that we live in and our place within it.</p>
<h2>Ulster Museum</h2>
<p>The Ulster Museum is the oldest of the four, its collections originating with the formation and activities of the Belfast Natural History Society (1821), re-named the Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society (1842), and the closely associated Belfast Naturalists&#8217; Field Club (1863). During most of the 19th century, their focus was on developing collections mainly in the area of natural history, but also archaeology and ethnography, and displaying these in the Belfast Museum which had been opened by the Society in 1831. Separately, in 1890, the opening, by the Belfast Town Council of the Belfast Art Gallery and Museum provided a catalyst for broader collections development, embracing not only art but also antiquities and a greater capacity for natural history specimens. A critical mass was created in 1910 when the collections of the Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society were acquired by the Belfast Art Gallery and Museum. This led ultimately to the construction of a new building, the Belfast Museum and Art Gallery at Botanic Gardens, which opened in 1929, and the establishment, through the Museum Act (Northern Ireland) 1961, of the Ulster Museum as a national institution. The Ulster Museum opened in 1972.</p>
<p>The nature and development of the Ulster Museum&#8217;s collections reflect the above history. A number of 19th-century natural historians, travellers and benefactors are particularly noteworthy. These include William Thompson (botany and ornithology), Sir James Emerson Tennant (entomology), Gordon A Thomson and George Benn (antiquities), and James McAdam (palaeontology). Embracing most, if not all, of these areas was Canon John Grainger who, shortly before his death in 1891, donated his complete collection of geological and zoological specimens, antiquities and art objects to the Belfast Art Gallery and Museum – as a result of which he has subsequently been referred to as ‘The Father of the Ulster Museum&#8217;. All these subject areas have been enriched and enhanced by subsequent collecting, several aspects meriting mention. Critical to the development of the botany collection was the gift by The Queen&#8217;s University of Belfast of its herbarium (1968).</p>
<p>A substantial part of the Archaeology collection is derived from the early days of antiquarian activity in Ireland during the mid-1800s; from material displayed in the ‘Belfast Museum&#8217; (1831-1910). Some of these archaeological collections, including those of the Rev. Canon Grainger, are substantial. While the majority of the collections and objects on display were found by members of the public, the Museum acquired a number of pioneering excavations particularly those from Neolithic megalithic tombs. Excavations undertaken by previous members of staff include evidence of Ireland&#8217;s earliest settlers at Mount Sandel Co. Londonderry and substantial holdings from the urban medieval excavations of Carrickfergus.</p>
<p>The collection and display of industrial archaeology formed part of the policy of the Ulster Museum from the 1960s, under the then Directorship of Mr William Seaby. The driving force for this activity was W.A. McCutcheon, who conducted new and intensive research into the subject matter between 1956 and 1968 and expressed his ‘deep conviction of the relevance and validity of industrial archaeology&#8217;. From 1968 to 1974 this research was translated into new displays on engineering history at the Ulster Museum. Machinery and other material culture were accessioned into the permanent collection of the Ulster Museum, whilst archival material and photographs associated with McCutcheon&#8217;s research were gifted to the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI). The Ulster Museum&#8217;s collection includes material from all of the major industries for which the north of Ireland was once renowned, including linen production, heavy engineering, ship-building, rope making and brick making.</p>
<p>The development of the art collection was stimulated during the early part of the last century by some significant gifts and bequests. The former are exemplified through JMW Turner&#8217;s <em>The Dawn of Christianity</em>, gifted in 1913, and 34 of his own works presented by the distinguished Belfast-born artist Sir John Lavery in 1929. The bequest of Sir Robert Lloyd Patterson, given to the Belfast Art Gallery and Museum in 1919, was significant in that the paintings were sold some ten years later, with the approval of the trustees of Lloyd Patterson, on condition that the proceeds be used to acquire other works representative of the contemporary British school. This was an important factor in the subsequent shaping of the collection which, through successive shifts in acquisition policy, has grown to encompass not just the work of Irish painters but also British, European and American, both historical and contemporary.</p>
<p>Since the 1890s, acquisitions for the Fine Art collection have been made by purchase, gift and bequest, either from individual benefactors or on behalf of organisations including the Art Fund, the Contemporary Art Society, the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, the Elisabeth Frink Foundation, the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, the Haverty Trust and the Friends of the National Collections of Ireland. Notable acquisitions have been supported by grants from the Art Fund, the Esme Mitchell Trust, the Friends of the Ulster Museum, the Department for Communities, the Heritage Lottery Fund and the National Heritage Memorial Fund. A small number of acquisitions have been made by public subscription. In 2012, the Arts Council NI collection was gifted to National Museums NI. Since 1998, the Fine Art collection has been enriched through the acceptance in lieu of six major works. The Dutch collection has been significantly strengthened by the allocation of a Jan van der Heyden, an exceptional Jacob van Ruisdael and six etchings by Rembrandt. The Post-war British collection has received major works by Ben Nicholson and Frank Auerbach. Most recently, in 2021, a magnificent Tissot of an Irish sitter has filled what had been a serious gap in the 19th century European and British collection.</p>
<p>The works of art on paper collection, the largest fine art collection, has multiple areas of strength owing to significant donations and past acquisitions. Many of these donations were given in the late 19th and early 20th century forming the foundation of the collection, the treasured Henry Fuseli drawings were given by the first curator of the Art Gallery when it was on Royal Avenue, in 1890. A significant donation of wood engravings from Lady Mabel Annesley given in 1939 forms the basis of the print collection and various schemes, such as the National Art Collections Fund, have bequeathed important works e.g. by Ruskin and Rossetti. Donations of local importance by individuals such as John and Roberta Hewitt have also been significant.</p>
<p>The applied art collections, which comprise ceramics, glass, silver and metalwork, furniture and wood, costume and textiles, jewellery and a childhood collection has two areas of particular strength, namely the 18th century and the contemporary period. The historic collections are of predominantly Irish material, and the contemporary are international in scope. The Ulster Museum represents the only public collection of international contemporary applied art in Ireland.</p>
<p>The current Ulster Museum collection of fashionable dress, accessories, and textiles essentially replaces the one that was lost when Malone House, where the former collection was stored, was burnt down following its bombing in 1976. Beginning from a ‘clean slate&#8217; the museum was forced to re-examine our collecting policy. This prompted a particular focus on developing a strong 20th-century fashion collection. Each year, since 1984, two complete outfits for spring/summer and autumn/winter have been purchased – one International designer outfit and one high street outfit. This unbroken chain of contemporary fashion acquisitions is a unique achievement for the Ulster Museum, one of the very first museums in the world to recognise the significance of collecting contemporary fashion. As far as rebuilding the textile collection, major acquisitions concentrated on areas where the nucleus of a collection was still in existence, including the important 1712 Lennox Quilt.</p>
<p>Between 2016 and 2020 the Ulster Museum developed its history and art collections through ‘Collecting the Troubles and Beyond&#8217;, funded through the National Lottery Heritage Fund&#8217;s Collecting Cultures programme. This involved the acquisition of significant collections including the NI Prison Service collection, the James Ellis collection, the Tom Hartley collection, artwork by Geordie Morrow and contemporary photographic collections representing well-known photographers including Martin Nangle and Frankie Quinn. This collecting activity focussed on Northern Ireland&#8217;s recent past and its legacy that continues today.</p>
<h2>Ulster Folk Museum</h2>
<p>The genesis of the Folk Museum lies in a memorandum prepared in 1943 about a post-war policy for the Belfast Museum and Art Gallery (see paragraph 2.2.1) in which the then Director, Sidney Stendall, advocated the creation of an open-air museum. This aspiration was pursued by his successor Wilfred Seaby and, following a favourable report presented to the Northern Ireland Parliament, the Ulster Folk Museum Act was passed in 1958. The Folk Museum&#8217;s remit was to illustrate the ways of life, past and present, and the traditions of the people of Northern Ireland. Individuals influential to the development of the Folk Museum included, in addition to those mentioned above, Estyn Evans, a pioneer in the study of folk culture in Ireland, and its Directors, George Thompson and Alan Gailey. The current site, at Cultra, County Down, was purchased in 1961.</p>
<p>The Folk Life and Agriculture collections focus on ways of life and traditions of the people of Northern Ireland in a western European context from the late nineteenth century through to the early decades of the twentieth century. They include material culture representing buildings, domestic life, agriculture, craft and textiles, and nonmaterial culture including traditional music and oral histories. Duncrun Cottier&#8217;s House was the first building to be selected, dismantled and brought to the Cultra site in 1961. The building was re-erected and completed in 1963. The Ulster Folk Museum formally opened in July 1964 along with the Coalisland Spade Mill. They were soon joined by more buildings and the rural area of the open-air museum began to flourish. The rural area of the open-air museum is a representation of a dispersed settlement, common to Ireland, with dwellings and public buildings reflecting regional variations scattered through an open landscape. Much was put into the spaces between buildings, the ditches, the field boundaries etc. as well as the construction of the buildings themselves. Most of the buildings were brought brick by brick from their original locations, Ballydugan Weaver&#8217;s House being the only replica building in the rural area of the museum. In due course, the museum decided to establish a small town. Some of the buildings in this area had already been reconstructed to be part of the dispersed settlement, but they were later incorporated into the new townscape. With the building of the town, there was a drift towards constructing replica buildings, instead of moving entire buildings from their original situation, as had been the earlier policy. Today, there are over 50 buildings on the site.</p>
<p>In parallel with these developments, an equally wide-ranging body of material relating to ways of life and traditions was collected through targeted fieldwork over many years. This has not only complemented the buildings but also provided important evidence of the rich social fabric of Ulster and the day-to-day lives of people. It covers such areas as farming, crafts and domestic life through both objects and archives. The latter include rich collections of photographs, the most important of which are those taken by W A Green and R J Welch, and sound recordings covering oral and aural histories such as music, folk tales and linguistic diversity.</p>
<p>The foundation for the costume and textiles collection was laid by one of the first group of curators, Katherine Harris, in the early 1960s. Harris&#8217; background in geography and ethnography served her well as she explored and collected fine examples of local dress and textiles, in many cases directly in conversation with those who were born and raised in the late 1800s. Her interest in material culture and traditional craft skills spanned across a range of media including straw work, needlework and everyday dress. Over a period of almost ten years Harris collected, exhibited and published aspects of the Folk Museum&#8217;s collection of dress and textiles. Some of the most significant objects in the collection were acquired during this period, including fine examples of Irish lace, linens, and bedcovers.</p>
<p>In the fifty years since Katherine Harris&#8217; retirement from the museum, the collection has been developed further by three successive Curators of Textiles, each bringing with them, in turn, specialisms in the study of Home Economics, Folklore, and Design for Fashion and Textiles. As a result, the collection has grown considerably in both size and quality to its present status as a comprehensive archive of dress and textiles in Ulster from 1730 to the present day. A recently developed contemporary collecting plan has supported the acquisition, through purchase, of a number of objects illustrating technical and design skills, from Irish makers.</p>
<h2>Ulster Transport Museum</h2>
<p>Alongside the emergence of the Folk Museum, a museum dedicated to transport was also being considered by the above-mentioned Wilfred Seaby, Director of the Belfast Museum and Art Gallery. A local committee of transport enthusiasts presented a number of vehicles, mainly rail, to the Belfast Museum on the understanding that they, together with other transport items already in the Museum&#8217;s collection, would be maintained and developed. Between 1954 and 1956, two buildings were leased in Belfast to hold the growing collection. New premises at Witham Street, Belfast, were purchased in 1960, a curator was appointed in 1961 and the new Belfast Transport Museum, under Belfast Corporation control, was opened in June 1962. It remained under Corporation control until responsibility was transferred to the Trustees of the Folk Museum in 1967 through the Ulster Folk Museum Amendment Act. At the same time, the Dalchoolin site, located a short distance away from the Folk Museum, was acquired as the site for the new Transport Museum. In 1973, the official name of the institution was changed to The Ulster Folk and Transport Museum to reflect the amalgamation.</p>
<p>Today the Transport Museum lies within a 40-acre site, representing almost forty years of incremental development in the opening of a Transport Gallery in 1976, a Rail Gallery in 1993 and a Road Gallery (1995). Influential figures in the early development of the transport collections, particularly road and rail, included the first curator, Robert Beggs, and Robert Galbraith. These collections include extensive and representative holdings of Irish railway vehicles, significant items being received from the Ulster Transport Authority (now Translink) and Córas Iompair Éireann. Public and private road transport is reflected in items ranging from horse-drawn vehicles to a De Lorean car.</p>
<p>The collections also cover transport associated with sea and sky. Of particular significance in the former category are Result, a 19th-century schooner, one of some 200 vessels comprising the UK National Historic Fleet and ship plans from Harland &amp; Wolff, Belfast&#8217;s major shipyard, including design drawings for Titanic. The latter includes items ranging from a Shorts SC.1 vertical take-off aircraft, a Rex McCandless designed autogyro to a Martin Baker ejector seat and a Merlin Spitfire engine. Due to challenges associated with collections care and storage and a lack of curatorial expertise, the maritime and aviation collections have not been reviewed or significantly developed since the late 1990s.</p>
<h2>Ulster American Folk Park</h2>
<p>The Ulster American Folk Park opened in 1976, two individuals &#8211; Eric Montgomery and Dr. Matthew T. Mellon &#8211; being particularly prominent in its establishment and early development. The former had been instrumental in setting up the Ulster Scot Historical Society (now the Ulster Historical Foundation) to undertake research into Ulster-American links. During the 1960s, with government support and the active cooperation of the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland, Eric Montgomery developed proposals to restore the ancestral homes of notable Americans whose forebears had emigrated from Ulster. One such building was a County Tyrone farmhouse, birthplace of Judge Thomas Mellon, the banking and industrial magnate of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. This was the context in which Dr. Mellon expressed his interest and his support would lead to the restoration of the Mellon Farmstead and, ultimately, the creation of the Ulster American Folk Park.</p>
<p>The site, approx. 80 acres, seeks to tell the story of emigration from Ulster to America from the 17th to the 19th centuries and uses objects and buildings to reflect experiences in both places. Whilst the Ulster dimension is more developed, largely through eight vernacular buildings, significant progress has been made in correcting this imbalance by the importation and reconstruction of historic structures, now numbering five, from Pennsylvania, Virginia and Tennessee.</p>
<p>While objects in the collection cover primarily domestic life and crafts, and farming, they also cover areas that inform the wider story of emigration, the most noteworthy being the Paul Louden-Brown White Star Line Collection acquired in 2010. Comprising over 7000 objects, it illustrates the context of Titanic through the history of its parent company.</p>

				     	<p>The collections of National Museums NI are estimated to be in the region of 1.4 million items. The collections are multidisciplinary, diverse and span all time periods, referencing Northern Ireland within and to the wider world. Historically, they have grown on the site-based framework of the Ulster Museum, the Ulster Folk Museum, the Ulster Transport Museum and the Ulster American Folk Park. However, since similar collection types can relate to more than one site, they are more appropriately classified within three broad and complementary subject areas. National Museums NI will continue to collect within these subject areas and the time periods and geographic areas to which they relate. The subject areas are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Art</li>
<li>History</li>
<li>Natural Sciences</li>
<li>Art</li>
</ul>
<p>The art collections include fine and applied art and incorporate both historical and contemporary material, mainly within an Irish context but also including some significant international holdings. In excess of 14,000 works, the art collection contains paintings, sculptures, works on paper, lens-based media, Troubles art, glass, ceramics, silver and metalwork, jewellery, furniture, costume and textiles. These collections are significant at both a national and an international level.</p>
<p>The Irish Art collection spans the 17th century to the contemporary. Almost all major Irish artists and movements are represented, with particular strengths in landscape, portraiture and subjects associated with the north and west of Ireland. In 1929, the Belfast-born Sir John Lavery (1856-1941), a leading ‘Irish Impressionist&#8217;, donated thirty-four paintings from all periods of his career including ‘Under the Cherry Tree&#8217; and ‘The Green Coat&#8217;, a dazzling full-length portrait of his wife Hazel. The landscape and life of the West of Ireland is of particular importance characterised, during the early 20th century, by the work of Paul Henry, William Orpen, Jack B.Yeats and Sean Keating, and in the post-war generation by Gerard Dillon, Derek Hill, Barrie Cooke and many others. Strengths of the twentieth-century collection include Irish Modernism and Irish artists of international importance, such as Mainie Jellett, Louis le Brocquy, William Scott and Willie Doherty. The figurative tradition remains strong in Northern Irish post-war painting, and is represented by Charles Lamb, William Conor, Colin Middleton, John Luke, Dan O&#8217;Neill, Basil Blackshaw and many others. In portraiture, a group of 18th century Belfast sitters by Strickland Lowry and Joseph Wilson is notable, as is a series of 20th-century literary portraits, including the first Portrait of Seamus Heaney commissioned from Edward McGuire in 1974, and the last portrait completed months before the poet&#8217;s death in 2013 by Colin Davidson. Recent acquisitions have focused on the Irish landscape, and include work by Elizabeth Magill, Melita Denaro, William McKeown and Paddy McCann.</p>
<p>The 20th century and contemporary collection are of outstanding international importance. Successive curators have strengthened these areas to form one of the most impressive collections of modern and contemporary art in the U.K. outside London. The early 20th-century British collection includes work by Stanley Spencer, Walter Sickert, Duncan Grant and others of their generation. The International Post-war represents the largest and most important area of the collection, and includes Sam Francis, Joan Mitchell and ‘Colour Field&#8217; artists Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland and Helen Frankenthaler. European post-war painting is represented by, among others, Karel Appel, Jean Dubuffet and Antoni Tapies, and the German ‘Group Zero&#8217; by Gunther Uecker, Otto Piene and others. British art is particularly strong in abstract painting with excellent St. Ives artists including Peter Lanyon, Roger Hilton, William Scott and Ben Nicholson. Two of the most important works in the collection are an exceptional early Francis Bacon <em>Head 11</em> (1949), and a seminal Barbara Hepworth <em>Curved Form</em> (Delphi), (1955). The later 1960s, 70s and 80s includes work by Bridget Riley, Anthony Caro, Joseph Beuys, Gilbert and George and many others. Recent acquisitions include the manga-influenced Japanese painter Makiko Kudo, Belfast-born Hannah Starkey, whose photographic work considers the urban experience of young women, and two sculptures that address themes of climate emergency and migration; <em>The Dog that lost its Nose</em> (2009) by Siobhan Hapaska and <em>Blue Sky Thinking</em> (2019) by Patrick Goddard. A collection of time-based media was begun in 2008, and includes major work by Willie Doherty, Bill Fontana and Cornelia Parker.</p>
<p>The Italian collection includes some of the first paintings to enter the Ulster Museum collection. In 1893, an exceptional pair of genre portraits by Giacomo Ceruti were bought as ‘foundation pictures&#8217; and are the most important works by the artist in the UK. The collection was transformed in the 1960s by the acquisition of two major 17th century paintings, <em>Allegory of Fortune</em> by Lorenzo Lippi and <em>St Cecelia</em> by Giovanni Francesco Romanelli. The Flemish collection includes a small group of 15th-century panels attributed to the Master of the Legend of St. Catherine, the Master of the Female Half- lengths and an impressive School of Bruges ‘Virgin and Child&#8217;, known as the Carrickfergus Madonna. The acquisition of Moses Striking the Rock by Hendrik van Balen, a gift through the Art Fund in 2021, has considerably strengthened the Flemish collection. The Dutch collection has recently been transformed by two major acceptances in lieu: <em>The Cornfield</em> by Jacob van Ruisdael, a masterpiece of international importance from the Beit Collection, Russborough, and a <em>View of the Palace of the Dukes of Brabant, Brussels</em> by Jan van der Heyden. The British collection is strongest in portraiture, usually of sitters with local or Irish connections. One of the most important paintings in the collection is an exceptionally fine late work by J.M.W. Turner <em>The Dawn of Christianity (The Flight into Egypt</em>), 1841. Most recently, in 2021, a magnificent Tissot <em>Quiet</em>, 1881, of an Irish sitter, has filled what had been a serious gap in nineteenth-century French and British painting.</p>
<p>There are two major strengths to the works of art on paper collection, the first is its ability to demonstrate various shifts and important movements in this mode of artistic production: Works by John Ruskin and J.D. Harding demonstrate the emergence of watercolour painting being popularised and considered a ‘fine art&#8217;. A large collection of wood engravings represents the importance of the wood-engraving revival and how women artists were at its centre. A donation of Rembrandt etchings through the acceptance in lieu of tax scheme celebrate his impact on printmaking which can be seen through over 300 years of the practice in the collection. The second strength is seen through large, or significant, holdings of work by individual artists including, for example, Henry Fuseli, Andrew Nicholl, Elisabeth Frink and Mainie Jellett.</p>
<p>The Ulster Museum has the largest collection of artworks that relate to the Troubles. Throughout the 30-year period and up until today artists from Northern Ireland and beyond have responded to the conflict through their artistic practice and a variety of media, including painting, sculpture, works on paper, lens-based and ceramic. During the period of the conflict, the Ulster Museum did collect several significant artworks, including <em>Woman in Bomb Blast</em>, 1974, by F. E. McWilliam, <em>…morning workers pass…</em>, 1978, Rita Donagh, <em>Ulster Crucifixion</em>, 1978, Ken Howard and <em>The Other Cheek?</em>, 1998, John Keane. It is only in more recent times, which has included the substantial gift of the Arts Council of Northern Ireland&#8217;s collection in 2012 that the collection has grown to its current level of significance. Since 2014 the Ulster Museum has also acquired work by artists including Mary McIntyre, Donovan Wylie, Dan Shipsides, Gerry Gleason, Peter Richards, Ursula Burke, Jack Pakenham and Gladys Maccabe, through purchase, gifts and donations.</p>
<p>The Arts Council of Northern Ireland (ACNI) gifted collection provides the context and foundation of the wider Ulster Museum art collection. It demonstrates contemporary artistic practice in the region across the past 40 years, not just through local artists work but also through the international &#8211; with artists who exhibited or worked here. It also reflects more than just the physical art, but maps the galleries and cultural activity of this place. Though it is one gift it represents two collections; the CEMA collection, formed in the early years of Northern Ireland&#8217;s existence and the ACNI collection, which began in the mid-1960s and as a result represents the artistic practice in relation to the conflict. Another area of strength is the number of works that connect to performance. It can be seen as a teaching collection as it teaches us about our own visual past.</p>
<p>The fashion collection has several strengths. The historic fashionable dress section is especially strong in the 18th century. This includes an 18th-century court suit belonging to the 2nd Earl of Belvedere, a cut velvet and metal thread suit worn by the Black Rod of the Irish Houses of Parliament in 1751, and a rare court mantua gown. Additionally, the donation of the textile heiress Elizabeth Balfour Clark&#8217;s 1911 court dress and train has highlighted an emerging collection of court dress with the Ulster Museum. Also held are outfits of almost every year from the mid-18th century to the present day. The fashion dolls, which complement the historic garments, are the most important element of the childhood collection. However, it is the 20th-century haute couture and contemporary fashions which are the most distinctive elements of the fashion collection. Every designer of note is represented, from Poiret, Chanel and Dior to McQueen, Galliano and Westwood. High street retailers both physical and online are also represented.</p>
<p>In terms of textiles there is a small but important collection of 18th-century bed furniture, mostly by named Irish embroiders. This includes the 1712 Lennox Quilt made by Martha Lennox, daughter of the Sovereign of Belfast, the Delany bedcover, a by Mary Delany, the well-connected 18th-century artist and epistolarian, and the Antrim bed furniture, a complete set worked by or under the supervision of Lady Helena McDonnell, 1705-83, daughter of the 4th Earl of Antrim. Important tapestries and other textile wall art include the 18th-century <em>Pilgrimage to Mecca</em> set by Paul Saunders, Arabesque by Joshua Morris and the mid-20th century <em>Adam and Eve</em> by Louis le Brocquy. Most important of all, however, are two large wall hangings, <em>Océanie &#8211; Le Ciel and Océanie &#8211; La Mer</em>, by the French artist Henri Matisse.</p>
<p>The main strengths of the ceramics collection lie in British and European historic ceramics, Irish ceramics, Asian and the contemporary. The British and European historic collection comprehensively documents the development of pottery and porcelain from the late 16th century. The Irish collection, which has pieces dating from the 18th century is representative of all the major potteries in Ireland. There are significant and unique pieces of, amongst others, Dublin delftware by Henry Delamain, excavated material from the Downshire pottery, Belfast, Wade Irish Porcelain and one of the finest collections of First Period and Second Period Belleek porcelain. The Asian collection is a small but important element of the ceramic collection that puts the European pieces into context. This collection ranges from stoneware of the Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368) through to early 20th century Japanese porcelain. The Ulster Museum, from 1982, pioneered a contemporary collecting policy within the ceramic field. As the only public collection of international contemporary ceramics in Ireland, it continues to form an extensive, comprehensive and inspiring record of the work of ceramic artists.</p>
<p>The glass collection consists of mainly two areas. Firstly, the historic collection, which is made up of mainly English and Irish 18th and 19th-century glass. A highlight of this section is the group of 350 drinking glasses showing the development of such wares since the last quarter of the 17th century. There is, too, a comprehensive collection of decanters including many rare marked Irish pieces. Ireland was an important glass manufacturing region in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries and the collection reflects this. Each of the Irish factories is represented. Without doubt the most important piece in the Irish glass collection is the bowl and stand that was once owned by the Marquis of Bute. As one of the most spectacular pieces of Irish glass ever made it has no comparison in any public collection in Britain or Ireland. As with the ceramics collection, the Ulster Museum was innovative in its policy of collecting contemporary glass and this collection is unique in Ireland. With over 100 artworks, it is an internationally important collection that continues to chart new movements within the glass medium. The most significant work in the international contemporary glass collection is <em>Azure Ice Crystal Sconce</em> by Dale Chihuly, which is made up of elements cut at the Waterford Glass Factory.</p>
<p>The jewellery collection is, except for recent contemporary acquisitions, almost exclusively the gift of Mrs Anne Hull Grundy, art and jewellery historian, who had Northern Irish connections. Comprising some 700 pieces, it dates from the 16th century to the 1930s, and includes the best existing collection of 19th-century Irish jewellery. Recent contemporary acquisitions include a Ring Set by Wendy Ramshaw and jewellery by Zoe Arnold, Jane Adams, Grainne Morton, Katy Hackney and Emmeline Hastings.</p>
<p>The small, but significant furniture and wood collection comprises mainly Irish material, however, the earliest piece in the collection is an Italian marriage chest or cassone from the 16th century. The collection contains some very fine and important examples of Irish cabinet-making of the 18th century. As well as carved early mahogany pieces there are later 18th-century examples of the neo-classical style, including a side table by William Moore. Another significant example is a mirror dating from 1760 by Francis and John Booker of Dublin. The 20th century is represented by an elegantly designed and inlaid chest of drawers in the Art Deco style by James Hicks of Dublin and the only wood carved sculpture by Rosamund Praeger. Contemporary furniture includes work by Andrew Klimacki, Mary Little and Joseph Walsh</p>
<p>The historic Irish silver collection has few equals. The earliest piece, the &#8216;Loftus Cup&#8217;, is engraved with the words &#8216;This silver-gilt cuppe was made of the great seale of Ireland in 1593, Adam Loftus being then Lord Chancellor….&#8217;. Seventeenth-century pieces include two fine porringers of 1685, a tankard of 1679 and a rosewater dish of 1658. The 18th-century collection is particularly strong, with all the styles and influences of the time represented. The single most important acquisition is the &#8216;Kildare Toilet Service&#8217;, a uniquely large and complete 28 piece silver-gilt toilet service, made for the dressing table of the wife of the 19th Earl of Kildare to celebrate the birth of their son. Made by David Willaume of London, it dates from 1720-22. The contemporary silver collection to is primarily Irish, with pieces by leading Irish silversmiths, however, the collection has recently expanded to include work by international silversmiths.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The History collections reflect evidence of people and events from the earliest settlers, through the main archaeological and historical periods and up to the present day. They also include significant material from various world cultures.</p>
<h3>Archaeology</h3>
<p>The archaeology collections span the time from the arrival of Ireland&#8217;s first Mesolithic settlers (c. 8000 BC) up to the later Medieval period (c. AD 1600). The vast majority of the collection is local but of note is the internationally significant material from the Spanish Armada wrecks of the Girona and La Trinidad Valencera. A smaller range of material from a number of the classical civilisations includes Rome and Greece and there is a dedicated gallery to finds from Egypt including the display of the mummified remains of Takabuti.</p>
<p>During the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods the major flint and stone outcrops that occur in the northern part of Ireland is reflected in the substantial amounts of stone artefacts acquired. This includes the Malone Road hoard, Belfast, of exceptionally large Neolithic polished stone axes. Bronze Age tools and weapons are well represented and more unusual items are a pair of Bronze Age musical horns from Drumbest, near Ballymoney in Co. Antrim. Items acquired as a result of the Treasure Act (1996) have added to the variety of Bronze Age gold jewellery on display. In contrast, Iron Age material is rarer.</p>
<p>The arrival of Christianity sees an array of new objects, some made specifically for the Church. The Museum&#8217;s active involvement in recovering material from the dredging of the River Blackwater which borders Co. Armagh and Tyrone added significantly to this aspect of the collections. It includes the 7th-century Clonmore shrine, Co. Armagh (a decorated receptacle to hold the relics of a Saint) along with evidence of Viking gold, silver and material raided from church sites.</p>
<p>One of the most significant recent acquisitions is the 10th-century bronze hand bell from Ballyclog, Co. Tyrone (on display). It is one of the few bells associated with a Christian settlement that has connections to St. Patrick. Objects from settlement sites also increasingly feature as do the first signs of urbanisation including coinage. Moving towards the 1600s, part of the collections reflect the conflict and political relationships with England.</p>
<h3>World Cultures</h3>
<p>The World Cultures collection numbers some 4,500 items. It is closely linked to the history of the Ulster Museum and primarily covers material from the Arctic, Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Oceania (including Australia and New Zealand). Objects in the collection include baskets, masks, figures, tools and weapons, clothing and jewellery. One of the rarest items in the collection is a tapa cloth figure from Easter Island, one of only two other known examples in the world.</p>
<p>Most items were acquired in the 19th and early 20th centuries, by members of the Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society. The European bias and power imbalances that characterised this collecting leave a complex and sensitive legacy to address today. Whilst some material was acquired legitimately, the collection does include objects which present significant ethical issues. In light of the decolonisation agenda within museums, the implementation of a new approach to these collections is a priority for National Museums NI.</p>
<h3>Modern History</h3>
<p>The Modern History collections cover a range of objects relating to the political, social and economic history of Ireland, including archival materials (photographs, maps, paper ephemera), paintings, books, banners, costumes, weaponry, coins, banknotes, medals and tokens.</p>
<p>The two centuries to 1700 were frequently punctuated by upheaval and war and yet these turbulent years saw the development of the modern economy. The conflicts of the era are reflected in the weapons and armour in the collection. Coins, trading tokens, printed material and religious items trace the rapid development of civilian life in the shadow of war. With political stability in the eighteenth century came rising prosperity, an enriched cultural life, and an appetite for new ideas. The artefacts in National Museums NI collection from this era reflect this growing wealth. Silverware, pottery, and jewellery speak to a new opulence. Pieces of regalia of the Order of St. Patrick, a dormant order of chivalry once as exalted as the Order of the Garter, are part of this collection. Growing inequality in society is demonstrated in ‘penal crosses&#8217; and beggars&#8217; badges.</p>
<p>The late 18th century witnessed the American and French Revolutions, encouraging radical thought. The United Irishman&#8217;s rebellion in 1798 was eventually crushed, and the Act of Union was passed in its aftermath. The collection includes military uniforms, weapons, and personal belongings of significant figures involved in this struggle, including the sword and coat of Henry Joy McCracken, industrialist and revolutionary, and the death mask of agitator and organiser, James Hope. The industrial collection contains a wide range of engineering and linen-related material from this period, charting Ulster&#8217;s growth from a largely agrarian to industrial society. The Great Famine of the 1840s made the gulf between rich and poor all too apparent, and the collection holds famine tokens and cooking pots from this period.</p>
<p>The Home Rule to Partition collection highlights this crisis period with examples of propaganda from both the Home Rule and Unionist campaigns, and artefacts and weapons from the Mountjoy II. The First World War prevented the Home Rule Act 1914 from being implemented, and the Easter Rising complicated an already difficult political situation. The collection includes a wide array of First War artefacts, including personal belongings and medals from both sides as well as objects from Ireland illustrating the rapid constitutional and social changes that were occurring. There are items from the Easter Rising and the partition of Ireland, and pieces that demonstrate the rising role of the women&#8217;s movement, and labour organisations. The significant Second World War collection includes uniforms, medals, and gas masks, as well as items related to Belfast&#8217;s wartime industry. The collection also reflects the political and social history of the 1950s and 60s with many political posters, objects relating to the civil rights movement and the wider cultural history including theatre and sporting memorabilia.</p>
<h3>Contemporary History</h3>
<p>The history of Northern Ireland from the late 1960s to the present day has been dominated by the civil and political conflict known as ‘the Troubles.&#8217; The events that took place here after 1968 have impacted not just the people of Northern Ireland, but people across the world. The collection covers themes of politics and conflict, and the impact of both on everyday life, people and communities.</p>
<p>The objects, photographs, political ephemera and artwork in the Troubles collection represent a wide range of experiences. The Troubles collection includes items directly associated with the conflict – a rubber bullet, improved explosive devices, firearms and a bomb disposal robot. There is a large collection of material associated with the Northern Ireland Prison Service as well as crafts and artwork created by prisoners in Armagh Women&#8217;s Gaol, HM Prison Maze and Magilligan. There are many emotive objects in the collection and those that remain contested in terms of significance and meaning amongst those who experienced the conflict.</p>
<p>The contemporary history collection also includes objects that represent our wider social, cultural and economic history. The collection is a dynamic one and it continues to be developed and refined. Recently acquired items include George Best&#8217;s Northern Ireland football jersey, a puppet of Gerry Adams from the TV series Spitting Image, material relating to the life and career of Belfast-born actor James Ellis and a collection of Pride t-shirts dating from 1991 when the first march was held in Belfast.</p>
<p>National Museums NI is committed to developing its approach to community history and our community history collection. This involves working with community partners to curate their history and ensuring our collection is more diverse and inclusive.</p>
<h3>Photography Collection</h3>
<p>National Museums NI holds a wide range of historic photographs most are in black and white and kept in print and negative format. The collection dates from around 1870 and represents commercial and social life, industrial and economic activity, street scenes and townscapes, transport and political and social events. Key collections include the Harland &amp; Wolff Collection of shipyard photographs, bodies of work by W.A. Green, A.R. Hogg, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board collection and the Hackney Collection of First World War photographs charting the recruitment and training of the 36th Ulster Division in the First World War, and their journey to the Battle of the Somme and beyond.</p>
<p>Other important collections include the work of Cecil Newman, describing local urban and road development in the 1960s and 1970s; the Garland collection, which records the aftermath of the Belfast Blitz, 1941, and the work of local home defence agencies; the Glass Album relating to the Land War in Gweedore, County Donegal, in the 1880s; the Douglas Sobey Collection relating to the LGBT movement in Northern Ireland in the 1970s and photojournalism dating from the 1970s by Martin Nangle, Bill Kirk and Frankie Quinn.</p>
<p>National Museums NI maintains a large collection of lantern slides depicting social, economic, and industrial life in Ireland in the late 1800s and 1900s. A large photographic archive includes copies of major collections held elsewhere, such as the Annesly, Young, and Langham collections. The photographic collections also chart the development of photography itself. Our oldest photographs are daguerreotypes and calotypes from the dawn of the medium, and there is a collection of cameras, magic lanterns, and photographic equipment, dating from the 1850s onwards.</p>
<h3>Transport, Industry and Technology</h3>
<p>The Transport, Industry and Technology collections cover all forms of transport built or used in Ireland, from the late eighteenth century to the present day, and the industrial heritage of Ulster. The non-material collections comprise oral and aural histories giving an insight into transport and industry in Ireland and local people who have contributed to the development of transport around the world.</p>
<p>The collection of non-commercial road vehicles reflects the innovations of local manufacturers such as Harry Ferguson and Crossle but also charts the development of the road users vehicle as a status symbol from the turf carts used on farms to the luxurious carriages belonging to James Shein to the streamlined Rolls Royce as well as more contemporary vehicles such as the DeLorean and Clan Clover. Included in the collection are a number of military vehicles that reflect the civil war in Ireland during the 1920s as well as the more recent Troubles. The commercial vehicles show how public transport has grown not only in Belfast but in more rural areas of Ulster. There is an extensive motorcycle and bicycle collection highlighting local innovators like Rex McCandless&#8217; and his featherbed frame as well as local racing legends like Stanley Woods and endurance riders who gained notoriety for their sporting triumphs. The first cardiac ambulance in the world highlights emergency service vehicles, along with a number of fire engines.</p>
<p>The rail collection is a comprehensive overview of the growth of the railways in Ireland and the technological developments that occurred throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. It includes early steam engines that ran the lines in Donegal and Maebh, one of the largest engines to ever be seen on the Irish rail network. The innovation of the railbus and the popularity of the narrow gauge railway in Ireland are also important features of the collection. Included in this is the tram collection depicting early commuting in industrial Belfast at the turn of the century and their replacement by the trolleybuses.</p>
<p>The maritime collection mainly consists of locally made vernacular vessels that depict life by the coast through fishing, transport and recreation such as currachs, rowing boats from the North coast and oyster boats from Galway. The merchant schooner Result is the largest boat and its local connections to Carrickfergus and fascinating story make it a highlight of the collection. The local links continue through objects associated with the RMS Titanic, built in Belfast by Harland &amp; Wolff, and the important collection of ship plans depicting the shipbuilding heritage in Belfast from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century.</p>
<p>There is a strong local association with aviation through the Belfast Short Bros factory at Queens Island. A number of the aircraft in the collection were built by this company and some even tested over Belfast Lough such as the Shorts Sealand and the SC1, the first VTOL aircraft in the world. The local connections continue through replicas of Harry Ferguson&#8217;s monoplanes as well as a number of Miles aircraft which had a base out of Newtownards for a period after World War II.</p>
<p>The industrial revolution is of particular significance to the northeast of Ireland, which became a world leader in a range of industries. These industries boosted the economy and employed many thousands of local people across generations, meaning that the experiences of industrial life are integral to individual and community identity and heritage. Professor WA McCutcheon, an industrial archaeologist, was the driving force behind the development of the industrial collection in the 1960s. Machinery and other material culture was accessioned into the permanent collection, including material from all of the major industries for which the northeast of Ireland was once renowned, such as linen production, heavy engineering, shipbuilding and rope making. Significant specimens include six stationary steam engines that exemplify power generation in the 19th century, a Columbian printing press donated by The Belfast Newsletter, and looms, spinning frames and beetling machines representing the hugely significant linen industry.</p>
<h3>Folk Life and Agriculture</h3>
<p>The museum&#8217;s material culture collection is in part a study collection, and in part a resource for the open-air museum. It contains important collections of agriculture, domestic life, crafts, community life and dress and textiles. The domestic life collection is a particular strength, thanks in part to the need to furnish the buildings in the open-air museum. So too is the collection of dress and textiles which represents excellence in technical skills, creativity in design and wear, industry in the factory and on the farm, and an appreciation of dress and textiles as folk art, over a period of almost three hundred years in Ulster. There are rich agricultural collections including early seed winnows, threshers, ploughs, horse and farming-related material and an extensive spade collection highlighting the regional varieties.</p>
<h3>Costume and Textiles</h3>
<p>The collection of dress and textiles includes over 30,000 objects, the result of almost 60 years of fieldwork, research and acquisitions. It is the largest public collection of dress and textiles in Ireland and one of the largest of its kind in any open-air museum in the British Isles. One of the core strengths of the collection is dress and textiles from the period 1840 -1910, linens that reflect the growth of power loom weaving in Ireland, and both finished and working examples of whitework embroidery and lace.</p>
<p>One of the earliest pieces in the textile collection is a panel of lace for a child&#8217;s bonnet, believed to date from the early eighteenth century. The most recent acquisitions include examples of contemporary millinery, and a patchwork wall hanging made during the 2020 Covid 19 lockdown to celebrate the work of the NHS.</p>
<p>The collection covers a very wide area of dress and textiles but some of the more significant collections include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A collection of wedding dresses, from 1850 to 1990</li>
<li>A collection of regalia for brotherhoods in Ireland (including the Orange Order) from the mid-1800s to present day.</li>
<li>A collection of almost 100 objects for Irish Dance from the 1930s to the present day.</li>
<li>A large college of household linens 1790 to mid-1900s, including those produced by named manufacturers</li>
<li>A collection of over 400 examples of Irish lace from the mid-1800s to mid1900s</li>
<li>A collection of patchwork bedcovers and hangings illustrating a wide range of techniques and patterns, from the early 1800s to the present day</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sound Archive</h2>
<p>A non-material culture collection is held within the museum&#8217;s sound archive, largely stored on cassette or reels, although significant efforts are being made to digitise it. It is an extensive collection of recordings spanning transport, industry, crafts, folklore, language, traditional music and song. Whilst the bulk of the collection was amassed in-house by museum curators, some collections were acquired from external sources.</p>
<h2>Photography Collection</h2>
<p>The Ulster Folk Museum holds significant photographic collections capturing the way of life in Ireland, mainly Ulster c. 1850-1930, from notable photographers such as W. A. Green. Substantial in-house archive photography captured the history, activities and events of the Ulster Folk Museum from the early 1960s onwards. In addition to still images, the museum has collected moving images in the form of film over the years. This material is currently being digitised to enable researchers to view this historical portal to our past. In collaboration with Northern Ireland Screen, the museum is an access point to the &#8220;Digital Film Archive&#8221; that provides, via a computer station, 70 hours of digitised moving images about Northern Ireland from 1897-2000.</p>
<h2>Library and Paper Archive</h2>
<p>The library and paper archive deals with the subject matter of the museum. The library contains about 25,000 books and many periodicals, covering a wide range of topics from cookery to local history, from costumes to early motor cars. It includes a considerable collection of international journals concerned mainly with folklore and ethnology, many of which cannot be found elsewhere in the province. The archives have an equally wide scope, containing reminiscences, linguistic and folklore material, transport material, maps, plans and much more. Collections include the open-air museum buildings archive, folklife questionnaire collection and papers pertaining to notable individuals including Estyn Evans, Richard Hayward, George Thompson and Alan Gailey.</p>
<h2>Languages of Ulster Archive</h2>
<p>The Ulster Dialect Archive contains published and unpublished wordlists and glossaries that document the distinctive speech of the people of the area that comprises the old nine-county Ulster. Within that area, three principal dialect areas are generally distinguished. The first is Ulster-Scots (sometimes called ‘Scotch-Irish&#8217;). The second is Mid-Ulster English (also described as ‘Northern Hiberno-English&#8217; or ‘Ulster Anglo-Irish&#8217;). The third is the speech of those areas where Irish Gaelic is either still in use or has died out relatively recently. Most of the material in the archive is in the form of the written or printed word. However, a significant proportion is found within the museum&#8217;s sound archive. The paper-based dialect archive contains several manuscript collections, notably the Sir John Byers glossary (c. 1910), the Montgomery manuscript (County Antrim dialect, 1961), and the Huddleston manuscript (Ulster-Scots poetry and prose). Published collections include the donated Ulster-Scots library of Professor Robert J Gregg (1912-1998) and many now rare and out-of-print works. Much of the material in the collections have been electronically captured on a dictionary database. PDF copies of this dictionary are available for download either is a whole or by alphabetic letter.</p>
<h2>Emigration</h2>
<p>The Emigration collections relate to the interpretation of people in new places and are concerned primarily with social history surrounding the migration of people from Ulster and their settlement in North America from 1600 to the present day. These collections include: Ulster and American domestic miscellanea, textiles and costume; Ulster and American furniture, craft tools and agricultural implements; and, emigrant related buildings and associated building maintenance materials and fittings, drawings, photographs and other records.</p>
<h2>Natural Sciences</h2>
<p>The Natural Sciences collections show particular emphasis on the botany, geology and zoology of the north of Ireland but also include material of international provenance:</p>
<p>The Zoology collection holds examples of every mammal species living in Northern Ireland today, and skeletons of whales and dolphins that have washed up on these shores. The collection contains more than 2000 mammal mounts, skins, and skeletons. The finest of these are on display, while many more form an important reference collection. More than 300 bird species are known from Northern Ireland, and the collections include mounts of nearly all of them. Many were prepared in the early 20th century by the famous Sheals taxidermists of Belfast.</p>
<p>There are more invertebrates in the collection than all the other specimens combined. Most of the insect specimens are from the UK and Ireland, but many are from further afield. Among them are the exceptional collections of Morpho and Parnassius butterflies. There is also a significant collection of other invertebrates, particularly snails, from across Ireland.</p>
<p>The geology collection includes around 30,000 fossils, 11,000 mineral specimens, 4,000 rocks, and a growing collection of meteorites. Highlights of the fossil collection. include the only dinosaur bones ever found in Ireland, an Edmontosaurus skeleton and Giant Deer bones. The minerals collection includes examples of those first found in Northern Ireland &#8211; Larnite, Garronite, and Gobbinsite. In the rocks collection is iconic Mournes granite and Cushendun ‘pebble beds&#8217;, as well as the 1780 million year-old Inishtrahull gneiss, the oldest rock in Ireland. There is a small, but representative, collection of meteorites, including several that fell in Northern Ireland. Among them is a 113kg iron meteorite, spectacular slices of ‘stony iron&#8217; pallasites, a small Lunar meteorite, and many small pieces from the great Russian meteorite fall of 2013.</p>
<p>The herbarium started modestly—an alga, collected from a ‘boghole&#8217; in Co. Donegal in 1815. From there it has grown, with many types of plants represented in a collection of more than 100,000 specimens. The collection includes mosses and liverwort; seaweeds and pondweeds; ferns, flowers, shrubs and trees; fungi, lichen and slime moulds.</p>
<p>Related material includes a collection of manuscripts, drawings and contemporary wildlife art paintings, early and/or rare natural sciences books, transparencies and photographs, and data generated through fieldwork.</p>

				     	<p>Back in 1982 Nature in Art Trust (then called The Society of Wildlife Art of the Nations) was founded as a registered charity, by Dr David Trapnell (1928 – 2023). Its first president was Sir Peter Scott, renowned not just for his paintings, but also for establishing the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and co-founding the World Wide Fund for Nature. Nature in Art Trust was set up with the specific purpose of establishing and then managing a museum of art inspired by nature and thereby plugging a gap in the UK’s publically accessible collections.</p>
<p>Man is a painter and always has been. As early as 25,000 BC the subjects of his first paintings were animals. If it was man&#8217;s capacity for rational and abstract thought that helped someone decide to call him Homo sapiens (wise man), he might equally aptly have been called Homo pictor (man the painter). Long before language was reduced to writing, people drew pictures on the walls of the caves which were their homes.</p>
<p>From the tomb paintings of Egypt of around 2000 BC until the Middle Ages, man&#8217;s chief topic for his art was man, often depicted in his relationship to God and sometimes accompanied by domesticated or hunted animals and birds. With a few notable exceptions in China from about the ninth century AD onwards, it was not until the seventeenth century that artists turned again to give a significant proportion of their talents to making living, wild creatures the chief subject of their paintings, as distinct from decorative details in other pictures.</p>
<p>It is surely a remarkable fact that, while nature was the first subject for man&#8217;s artistic attention, it was largely overlooked for thousands of years and has only in the last four centuries again become an important stimulus to his creative endeavour. Perhaps then it is a surprise that, as far as we know, it was not until the opening of Nature in Art in 1988 that the broad heritage of art inspired by nature has been exclusively collected, displayed and celebrated.</p>
<p>While national art collections in many countries have been notable for the breadth and variety of their subject matter and the magnificent quality of the work they exhibit, they have largely neglected works of art depicting nature. Boosted by the growth all around the world of a sense of public and individual responsibility for conservation of the environment and our heritage in nature, and for inter-cultural dialogue, there is a new awareness of the value of fine examples of works of art from around the world which depict living things. Nature in Art responds to these trends.</p>
<p>Dr David Trapnell’s vision was partly inspired by visits to the USA where his wife, artist Elizabeth Gray, was exhibiting her artwork, also inspired by nature. Links were made with collections in this field including the Leigh Yawkey Woodson Museum in Wisconsin where work by Elizabeth Gray is held in the permanent collection.</p>
<p>At the time of its establishment the Trust had no collection or building and extremely limited funds. An Inaugural Exhibition was held in Guildhall in the City of London in 1985 which featured original works by some of the world’s foremost nature inspired artists, lent specifically for the exhibition. Opened by HRH Princess Alexandra it proved an effective springboard for moving the project forward.</p>
<p>By 1988, a small collection of 120 works had been assembled (some donated from the Inaugural exhibition). The trustees were able to raise sufficient monies to purchase outright and then convert a fine Georgian mansion. As a result the museum ‘Nature in Art’ opened free of debt on May 28th 1988. Still today, without any guaranteed ongoing public or private funding, the museum has remained debt-free.</p>
<p>Shortly after opening, a book, ‘Nature in Art’, was produced. Written by Dr David Trapnell and published by David and Charles, it featured many paintings and prints from the collection. The collection now stands at around 1300 items and is unique in its diversity and scope. The collection deliberately embraces a wide range of styles and media. Such diversity is important, not simply in collecting terms, but also to expand the visitor experience beyond their expectations.</p>
<p>Over the years, the Trust has gratefully benefited from support from the likes of The Art Fund and the V&amp;A Art Purchase Fund to acquire items, such as the most important painting in the collection, an oil on panel, &#8220;Noah and the Animals Entering the Ark&#8221;, attributed to Jan van Kessel (1660/1680), acquired in 1994. (This painting was loaned to a world-touring exhibition organised by the Victoria and Albert Museum). Other examples include a Malcolm Sutcliffe glass charger (1993), a Margaret Mee watercolour (1993), a Worcester quail pattern tea bowl and saucer (1995), a Jun Takegoshi (Japan) vase (1996), an Italian pietre dure table (1996), a Pilkington Lustreware vase (1997), an Anne Jones quilt (2001), a Japanese Cloisonne Koro (2002), a Jean Jules Dunand lacquer panel (2002), glass work by Jenny and Brian Blanthorn (2003), a Royal Doulton Lambeth Studio vase (2004), a Charles Frederick Tunnicliffe watercolour on paper ‘Green Gold and Dun’ (2006), Michael Porter&#8217;s’ oil and acrylic on canvas, ‘The Road to Issel’, (2007). a William de Morgan ceramic charger (2015) and a pencil drawing by Jospeh Wolf (2022).</p>
<p>To complement the collection, a comprehensive programme of temporary exhibitions is held, often built around items from the collection, or on themes or artists already addressed by the collection. Some ready-curated exhibitions are also included from time to time, borrowed from other institutions.</p>
<p>In 1989 the Museum was accepted for government indemnity which, for example, enabled the Trust to borrow five important paintings by Wilhelm Kunhert, Carl Rungius and Bruno Liljefors from the Rijksmuseum, Twenthe, Holland from 1990 – 2002.</p>
<p>The focus of the collection remains unchanged. The Trust currently only collects items that it will display. It has not disposed of any items and has no plans to do so.</p>

				     	<p>As far as we know, it was not until the opening of Nature in Art in 1988 that the international heritage of art inspired by nature has been exclusively collected, displayed and celebrated by a museum anywhere. Probably boosted by the growth of a sense of public and individual responsibility for the conservation of our heritage in nature and the environment, and for inter-cultural dialogue, there is now also an awareness of the true artistic merit of fine examples of nature-inspired art that have been neglected in public art collections for too long.</p>
<p>Quality in variety has been the consistent guiding principle of collecting by the Trust. The collection consists of top-quality examples of their kind of fine, decorative and applied art inspired by nature, in all media and styles. The following list demonstrates that some variety has already been achieved, shown by the different media and styles represented in the permanent collection, &#8211;</p>

				     	<h2>Norwich Castle Museum &amp; Art Gallery</h2>
<h3>Archaeology</h3>
<p>Archaeology was one of the principal collecting areas of the Norwich Museum from its first foundation in 1824. Although this has enabled the present-day collections to include various items found in the 19th century, the first major benefactor donating material was Robert Fitch, a Norwich chemist who donated a large antiquarian collection in 1894. His finds were principally collected from Norfolk with a few from Suffolk and covered most chronological periods. A particular interest of Fitch appears to have been the medieval period as two especially fine collections, of seal matrices and finger-rings, were among his donations and provide the basis for the Castle Museum&#8217;s maintained eminence in these areas.</p>
<p>Other major collections include those of the Beloe family, which has a good assemblage of pilgrim badges, and the Perowne bequest of medieval manuscripts, including ornately decorated psalters and a rare processional from Castle Acre priory.</p>
<p>Norfolk has always been archaeologically rich and a number of important excavations have been undertaken in the county, the archives of which were given to Norwich Castle. The Castle Museum has hence come to act as the county museum for archaeology and the repository for all county excavations. Among the more important sites in the collections are North Elmham Park, site of the Anglo-Saxon see of East Anglia; Spong Hill, Britain&#8217;s largest Anglo-Saxon cremation cemetery; and the Anglo-Saxon inhumation cemeteries of Bergh Apton, Morningthorpe, Harford Farm, Caister by Yarmouth and Burgh Castle. Medieval sites include the Castle Mall excavation, then the largest urban excavation in Europe.</p>
<p>The rise of metal-detecting in the 1970s saw a fundamental change in the way the archaeology collections developed and Norfolk was one of the first counties to embrace the hobby and liaise with detector users. The late Dr Sue Margeson was especially important in developing the collection with metal-detected finds, specialising in 10th-11th century Scandinavian finds from which she explored issues of ethnicity and migration that have now become current in modern scholarship. As a result, the Castle has a particularly fine collection of Early Medieval material.</p>
<p>Modern collecting has continued this lead and through an active acquisition policy, attempted to meet the challenge of Norfolk yielding more Treasure cases and more Portable Antiquities than any other county in UK. Rationalisation in recent years has attempted to refine the collections to having a Norfolk focus or, for prehistoric periods before the county border was a meaningful construct, an East Anglian relevance.</p>
<h3>Fine Art</h3>
<p>The earliest collection of paintings to be acquired by the Norwich Museum was in 1841 when Captain William Manby presented a unique collection of 17 seascapes in oil and watercolours. When an art gallery was first incorporated in the Norwich Museum in 1894 the nucleus of the collection was a gift of 80 Norwich School paintings from the East Anglian Art Society. In 1898, twenty major Norwich School paintings were bequeathed by JJ Colman of Colman&#8217;s Ltd.</p>
<p>The Norwich School collection was developed under the curatorship of James Reeve. The greatest gift to the collection was the Russell James Colman Bequest of 1946, which included thousands of Norwich School paintings, watercolours, drawings and prints and funds for the construction of art galleries to house them.</p>
<p>The Museum has acquired numerous items through gifts, bequests and purchases over the years, building a small but important collection of 17th century Dutch and Flemish art including 93 etchings by Rembrandt, among others.</p>
<h3>Decorative Art</h3>
<p>From its inception the remit of the decorative arts collections has included ceramics, glass, silver and jewellery from 16th century to the present day. Traditionally it has mainly comprised British objects, and very little European material. There were a few Oriental pieces, mostly of Chinese export porcelain, acquired mostly during the late 19th-early 20th century, although many of these were sold to Liverpool Museums in the 1950s, clearly reflecting a change of curatorial policy at the time.</p>
<p>The main focus of the collections has been and remains to emphasise works of greatest relevance to Norfolk, and/or East Anglia. These include Norwich-made silver, dating from the period of the city&#8217;s assay from 1567 through to 1697. The earliest Norwich silver donation occurred in 1894, from Robert Fitch, an important local benefactor who gave significant works of fine and decorative arts in all media, including the Chinese export wares referred to above. Lowestoft porcelain has also been an important focus for the collections, originating from the only factory in East Anglia, operational c1760-1800. Significant donations of Lowestoft porcelain were given during the 1920s-50s, particularly by Susanna Taylor in 1938 and Mrs Russell Colman in 1948.</p>
<p>In 1946 a bequest of over 600 18th century ceramic teapots from Edward Bulwer began the Castle&#8217;s collecting in this area. A purchase from Philip Miller of almost 2,000 19th-20th century teapots in 1992 later ensured the continued centrality of teapots within decorative arts at Norwich Castle.</p>
<p>Other major holdings in the decorative arts collection include 1,100 pieces of 18th-20th century jewellery, donated by the nationally important collector Mrs Anne Hull Grundy during the 1970s.</p>
<h3>Natural History</h3>
<p>Natural history collections formed the bulk of the original material acquired by Norwich Museum when it was formed in 1825. Most of the early exhibits were private collections donated to the Museum by its founders, and this tradition of donating by local naturalists continues today. Many early specimens were collected abroad but current policy places greater emphasis on local material. In the past, particularly important specimens were usually purchased but today most material comes from donation and staff fieldwork.</p>
<p>The bird collections include many fine examples of Victorian taxidermy. They mostly date from the 19th and early 20th centuries, but are still added to from road and weather casualties. There is a large collection of birds&#8217; eggs which is no longer added to for ethical and legal reasons; the two Great Auk eggs are the most important individual items.</p>
<p>Mammals include specimens from Victorian and Edwardian foreign expeditions including a Polar Bear and a notable group of antelope, including Nile Lechwe, as well as East Anglian specimens.</p>
<p>The entomology includes several large and important collections, notably the pre-eminent Fountaine-Neimy bequest of 22,000 Lepidoptera. This resulted from a lifetime&#8217;s collecting by Margaret Fountaine, who travelled all over the world from 1892. Her bequest included a sealed box which when opened in 1978 was found to contain twelve journals detailing her life from 1878 until her death in 1940. This combination of a scientifically important collection and sociologically significant literature is not unique but there are few naturalists who have collected in and written about sixty countries on six continents over fifty years. Much of the modern invertebrate material has been collected during recent survey work.</p>
<p>The most important collection of molluscs is that of WJO Holmes, with 12,000 British specimens.</p>
<p>The botany collections include a main herbarium of 50,000 vascular plants, mostly local material. They incorporate material from naturalists including JD Salmon, J Paget and EL Swann.</p>
<p>Geological specimens reflect the geology of Norfolk but the collection has been built up by the generosity of geologists who have donated or bequeathed their own collections which were often built up from trips further afield. Because of this the collections contain some exotic specimens.</p>
<p>Disposals have included foreign material given to Liverpool and Coventry Museums after the war, and part collections bought by the British Museum (Natural History) when it was actively seeking to acquire type material. Notable transfers of the latter sort include the Gurney birds of prey and Edwards&#8217; type series of Homopteran bugs.</p>
<h3>Costume &amp; Textile</h3>
<p>The Costume and Textile collections of Norwich Museums were originally part of the Strangers&#8217; Hall Museum. They were created as a domestic life collection that gives an understanding of how people lived through the clothes they wore, the textiles in their homes and the crafts they practised.</p>
<p>In 1922 the collections of Strangers&#8217; Hall were incorporated into the City of Norwich collections and are believed to be one of the earliest Social History museums in the country. Enriched with collections such as the 1938 Buxton donation which contained important 16th-18th century costume and domestic textiles, the Norwich collections had an excellent reputation among textile historians.</p>
<p>From the 1960s onwards the collections were proactively developed to include not only high status fashionable dress and textiles but also: working dress; sporting and leisure dress; religious dress; and Norwich textiles including Norwich shawls, pattern books of worsted cloths from the 18th century, and dress and furnishing silks and horsehair fabrics of the 19th century. The pioneering curator Pamela Clabburn was largely responsible for this systematic collecting programme and for raising awareness of the collections, especially those of the Norwich shawl industry, to the growing community of dress and textile historians working across the UK.</p>
<p>In 1973 the Costume Society held its annual conference in Norwich with the subject of Strata of Society, recognising the Norwich collections&#8217; pre-eminence in collecting working dress.</p>
<h2>Museum of Norwich</h2>
<p>The Museum of Norwich was known until 2013 as the Bridewell Museum. Since its redevelopment and redisplay (2009-12) the focus of the museum has changed from Norwich trades and industries to the wider story of the development of Norwich as a city.</p>
<p>The Museum of Norwich at The Bridewell, formerly the Bridewell Museum of Trades &amp; Industries, has its origins in the 1920s. In 1923 Sir Henry Holmes, a successful shoe manufacturer, bought the Norwich Bridewell with the intention of giving it to the City as a museum of local trades and industries. The Bridewell building itself already had a rich history, as home to the first Mayor of Norwich, as well as latterly becoming the city&#8217;s House of Correction.</p>
<p>The museum was opened by the Duke of York in October 1925. It presented items linked to Norfolk crafts and industries, with displays on printing, shoe making, local building techniques, agriculture, textiles, transport and engineering, country crafts and leather working. A display on blacksmithing was installed in the undercroft in 1936 and relocated upstairs in 1966. Those visiting in the 1950s would remember the display of live birds, which complemented the display on local canary breeding.</p>
<p>In 1975, the rural life collections were transferred to the newly established Gressenhall Museum, establishing a newly developing focus for the museum on the City of Norwich rather than the county of Norfolk.</p>
<p>In 1985, John Newstead, a local pharmacist, donated his extensive collection relating to pharmacy. The collection of over 2,400 items was then, like today, displayed as a traditional chemist shop made up of the contents and shop fittings of over sixty separate shops from across East Anglia.</p>
<p>The museum reopened in 2012 after a major redevelopment project. Following extensive public consultation, the building was made fit for the 21st century with ten refurbished galleries telling the story of Norwich and its people. New displays chart the progress of Norwich from Medieval times up to the present day, with the focus on telling those histories through individual lives. Objects from Strangers&#8217; Hall, the Costume &amp; Textiles collection and Norwich Castle Art collections were used to support the new focus. In particular large 20th century domestic life collections were used in galleries which focus on the city from 1900 onwards.</p>
<h2>Strangers&#8217; Hall</h2>
<p>Strangers&#8217; Hall is an historic house museum established in 1900 by its founder Leonard Bolingbroke, a local solicitor and antiquarian, who gifted the museum and its collections to the City of Norwich in 1922. His collecting interests were wide and can be found throughout Norwich&#8217;s museum and archive collections. He created open displays of period room settings and installed cased folk life collections. Much of the museum&#8217;s original furniture remains on display today.</p>
<p>The folk life ethos was developed by curator Frank Leney, drawing inspiration from the Scandinavian model of collecting based on local ways of life and traditional building preservation. The period rooms were enhanced by notable acquistions in the 1920s-30s. These included Tudor and Stuart furniture for the Great Hall, high quality textiles including a rare 16th century table carpet, fine Georgian dining furniture and the significant Londonmade 18th century glass chandelier.</p>
<p>In the 1960s-70s the collecting remit broadened under curators including Rachel Young and Pamela Clabburn. New period rooms were set out including architectural features such as panelling and ceilings from notable local buildings. The new focus prioritised the collecting of costume and textiles, where a large collection was rapidly accumulated. The costume and textile collections were moved out of Strangers&#8217; Hall in 1996 and are now housed at the Shirehall under the care of the Costume &amp; Textile Department.</p>
<p>An increasingly local remit developed for social history collecting in the 1980s-2000s under curators Fiona Strodder and Helen Renton with the aim of ensuring a record of 20th century domestic life in particular.</p>
<p>Large objects were collected initially but restricted storage has impacted upon the museum&#8217;s capacity to add to these collections in recent years. Limited collecting continues in key areas.</p>
<h2>Royal Norfolk Regimental Museum</h2>
<p>The proposal for a museum devoted to the Norfolk Regiment was first mooted in the regimental journal ‘The Britannia&#8217; in 1931. The editor wrote ‘It would undoubtedly be a useful institution in the Regiment and would serve as an interesting repository for many articles which now, being scattered, may eventually be lost, although of great Regimental interest. Many things which by themselves appear of little general interest would nevertheless be very useful in a Museum, and such articles as original operation orders, letters, photographs, articles of enemy equipment, or other battlefield relics would be most interesting.</p>
<p>By October 1934 a regular list of items being sent in for inclusion in the museum was being published. This was a collection set up by the Regiment for the Regiment and it remained in Britannia Barracks, in the Regimental Association offices until 1990, when The Royal Norfolk Regimental Museum came under the management of Norfolk Museums Service under the terms of a 25 year agreement between the Trustees of the Collection and Norfolk County Council. Initially the Museums Service only took on the items that were to be displayed, but gradually moved most of the collection and all the archive into its care. In 2015 the agreement was renewed for another 25 years.</p>
<p>Under the terms of this agreement the Trustees loan the collection to the Museums Service, and continue to support it through project grants. Norfolk Museums Service cares for the collection, displays it and employs curatorial staff to manage and provide access to it. The Trustees will, in consultation with the Head of Museums, acquire items for the Regimental Museum by purchase, gift or bequest. Such items are the property of the Trustees.</p>
<p>With the move of the collection into the NMS came a new focus in its display and interpretation into the social history of the regiment, and then the experience and stories of individual soldiers. In 2013 the Regimental displays were moved from the Shirehall Study Centre into the heart of the Castle Museum galleries.</p>
<h2>Gressenhall Farm &amp; Workhouse</h2>
<p>Curator Bridget Yates set up the Norfolk Rural Life Museum in 1976, having worked since 1970 on sourcing the rural life collections which would be its foundation. At its creation a significant number of rural items from the Norwich social history collections of the Museum of Norwich at the Bridewell (formerly the Bridewell Museum) and Strangers&#8217; Hall were transferred to the new museum.</p>
<p>Bridget was curator of the rural life collections for 18 years, collecting throughout the county, often at a prolific rate – at times 500 objects per week were collected. Another major influence on the collection was Dick Joice, who advised and supported the collection during its formative years in his role as Chairman of the Friends of Gressenhall. Collecting slowed in the 1980s and 1990s but continued to be focussed on rural crafts, trades and agriculture. The significant Taylor&#8217;s Collection from a seed merchant&#8217;s shop and warehouse, numbering over 5000 items, was collected in 1982.</p>
<p>During the early part of the 21st century there was a gradual change in collecting policy with a shift in focus to collecting specific crafts, trades and industries currently missing from the collection rather than the broader sweep of earlier years. From 2006 the Curator and Assistant Curator with the support of Bridget Yates (via a Monument Fellowship funded by the Museums Association) have worked to standardise collections management. Collecting now focuses on objects with a context. Significantly, it was not until 2014 that items relating to Norfolk&#8217;s workhouses were actively accessioned.</p>
<h2>Lynn Museum</h2>
<p>Lynn Museum was established in 1844 by members of the Lynn Conversazione and Society of Arts to educate and entertain local residents. It original collections were mostly natural history and ethnography. The museum has since built up social history, industrial history, maritime history, archaeology, decorative art, and fine art collections, which relate to King&#8217;s Lynn and West Norfolk.</p>
<p>In 1941, the Lynn Museum took on the collections of the Greenland Fishery Folk Museum following air raid damage to its building. Other major acquisitions include over 3,000 wooden patterns, numerous technical drawings, and paper templates from local engineering company Savages Ltd, acquired when the company closed in 1973, and over 2,000 items from Taylor&#8217;s seed merchants donated when the shop closed in 1982.</p>
<p>Recent significant acquisitions include an Iron Age coin hoard in a cow bone container, found at Sedgeford and purchased in 2005, and contemporary artist Steve Cale&#8217;s painting Fenland 8000 BC, a legacy of the Fenland project.</p>
<h2>Ancient House Museum</h2>
<p>The Ancient House Museum was opened in 1924 after Prince Frederick Duleep Singh bought the house and donated it to the town for use as a museum, along with funds for its renovation. He bequeathed 90 portraits, historical objects, and family memorabilia to the town collections, and further pictures were donated after his death. Items from the Thetford Mechanics&#8217; Institute collection of the late 19th century also helped form the original collection focusing on natural history and archaeology.</p>
<p>In its early days, the museum was associated with local antiquarians and natural historians such as WG Clarke (1877-1925) (author of In Breckland Wilds) and H. Dixon Hewitt FGS (1878-1966). During the 1950s and 1960s, staff from Norwich Castle Museum provided curatorial advice to the museum, and in 1974 it became part of Norfolk Museums Service, employing its own professional curator. Collecting broadened to include social and industrial history from the 20th century as well as archaeology, natural history, fine art, photography and ephemera.</p>
<h2>Cromer Museum</h2>
<p>The first significant addition to the museum archive, three years after it opened in 1978, was the Crawford Holden collection. It consisted of over 2,000 photographs, documents and books. It had been gathered over many years by a keen local historian. It retains a key importance in the museum archive. It had been held in trust for some years and the existence of this collection was partially instrumental in the creation of the museum itself.</p>
<p>Subsequent collecting by the Museum&#8217;s curators, donations and judicious purchases has led to the museum holding a significant archive relating to the town&#8217;s history. Martin Warren, curator from 1979 to 2000 and a keen geologist, built up a good collection of local fossils in his time at the museum both through his own collecting and donations from keen amateur collectors. As a result of the collecting policy there is little material that does not relate to Cromer and its environs. All of the collection has been documented (other than a normal backlog of recently acquired pieces). Over 17,000 images exist in the collection and the vast majority of the collection has been digitised. There are no significant rationalisation issues relating to the archive.</p>
<h2>Great Yarmouth Museums</h2>
<p>The Great Yarmouth collections are based over three museums in the town: The Tolhouse Museum &amp; Gaol, opened in 1883; the Elizabethan House Museum, run in partnership with the National Trust which acquired the building in 1951; and Time &amp; Tide Museum which opened in 2004.</p>
<p>The colleczions have been informed by the nature of each museum but a significant part came from the Shipwrecked Sailors&#8217; Home and the former Maritime Museum. The Sailors&#8217; Home on Marine Parade originally opened in 1861. It provided the survivors of shipwrecks with medical help, a change of clothes, food and a bed. It had a small museum which grew as sailors donated the souvenirs they had collected on their travels. The Home closed in 1964 and in 1967 the building reopened as the Maritime Museum which actively collected items relating to Great Yarmouth; the Museum closed in 2002. As the collections originate from a wide variety of sources there are varying levels of documentation across the collections and a range of collections management issues.</p>
<p>Significant individual items include Nelson&#8217;s funeral drape and an Anglo-Saxon log boat. There is a fine collection of ship models and an important local marine art collection, including Pierhead paintings.</p>
<p>The Captain Manby collection reflects the eccentric owner of the ship rescue mortar. It consists of his famous mortar which is on display, paper ephemera, paintings of Manby and personal items such as his medals, garments and accessories. The collection also includes the monument to him as well as the largest collection of his inventions in model form.</p>
<p>Also significant is the Press Collection. Joseph Press (1847-1851) was a traveller and sailor from an influential Great Yarmouth family who brought back many items he used aboard ship which are on display at Time &amp; Tide. The collection includes photographs and primary source material, including his own books and ledgers detailing his life and work as a merchant sea captain.</p>
<p>Collecting now focuses on objects with a context that relate directly to the Borough of Great Yarmouth and the three museums. Since the creation of Time &amp; Tide Museum the curatorial staff have done a great deal of work documenting the lives of fishermen, seaside landladies, offshore workers, the Port Authority, shipbuilders, herring curers and lifeboat crews in the local community. A community curators&#8217; forum has been employed to assist with contemporary collecting and commission films and photographs.</p>

				     	<h2>Norwich Castle Museum &amp; Art Gallery</h2>
<h3>Archaeology</h3>
<p>The Archaeology collections aim to tell the cultural and chronological story of Norfolk, and East Anglia, from the evolution of man to the post-medieval period. They are uniquely placed to do so as traces of the earliest human ancestors in northern Europe have been found in Norfolk, notably Happisburgh, which has yielded the earliest example of a north European handaxe. This and other material from the site is held by Norwich Castle Museum.</p>
<p>The archaeology collections are extensive, numbering over 2,000,000 items and have been Designated in recognition of their outstanding importance and international significance. They incorporate collections of numismatics, arms and armour, maps and manuscripts, ethnography, and foreign archaeology, in particular Egyptology.</p>
<p>While all chronological periods are represented, of particular strength are the Bronze Age, Iron Age and Anglo-Saxon collections. The Bronze Age material includes a large number of founder&#8217;s hoards of various sizes, rare moulds for casting spears and axes and gold work, among which the Wessex-culture grave-group from Little Cressingham and the composite rings from Gresham are notable. Iron Age finds include material from the ritual site at Snettisham including gold torcs, numerous coin hoards issued by the local Iceni tribe; and the excavation assemblage from the ritual complex at Thetford. Anglo-Saxon archaeology is a particular strength of the collections as it includes many excavation assemblages from cemeteries, with attendant grave-goods, and urban sites revealing the process of urbanisation. Outstanding features include Spong Man, the Harford Farm brooch, the Balthilde seal matrix and the second-largest collection of runic-inscribed objects in the UK.</p>
<p>Metal-detecting and ongoing rescue excavation in Norfolk continues to yield large quantities of material. While Norwich Castle Museum still acts as the central repository for excavation archives from the county, limited storage space will mean increased consideration of which archives are accepted in the future, those which have the greatest research and display potential being more likely to be accepted in whole or in part.</p>
<p>Metal-detecting provides a unique challenge as the material found annually is numerically so large and often of financial value which is realised by finders. The Archaeology Department maintains an active policy to acquire the most significant items either through the Treasure Act or through private purchases to maintain and enhance the existing collections.</p>
<p>Handling collections are usually made up of material that is accessioned but which duplicates existing other examples.</p>
<p>Old assemblages are already beginning to be reviewed for the potential to rationalise some or all of their components, while the records are retained. Rationalisation is not generally exercised simply on the basis of the duplication of material as archaeological artefacts are generally considered in terms of their data potential for research. Rationalisation is instead proposed on the basis of items considered of low academic research potential, or which derives from areas outside East Anglia and/or Norfolk.</p>
<h3>Fine Art</h3>
<p>The fine art collections of Norwich Castle Museum &amp; Art Gallery are Designated of National importance and date from the medieval period to contemporary art.</p>
<p>The collections include topographical material relating to Norfolk and Norwich including works by the Norwich School of Artists, Norfolk portraits, artists&#8217; personalia, and an art library. They comprise over 24,000 works of art. Of these, approximately 1,200 are paintings, 10,000 are watercolours and drawings and the remainder are prints, printed books and photographs.</p>
<p>Around 900 artists are represented in the collections. The most significant holdings are: Norwich School paintings and drawings (the most significant such collection anywhere in the world); landscapes of the British School; Dutch and Flemish art; Rembrandt etchings; and a small but important collection of modern and contemporary art from Impressionism to the present day.</p>
<h3>Decorative Art</h3>
<p>The decorative art collections of Norwich Castle Museum &amp; Art Gallery are Designated of national importance.</p>
<p>The decorative arts collection comprises just over 11,000 objects. Its Norwich silver and Lowestoft porcelain are particularly strong and highly important, both representing the largest collections of these media in public ownership, and including many rare or unique pieces. The ceramic teapots, almost 3,000 items, now represent the largest collection in the world. There is also a small but significant grouping of contemporary craft objects, acquired in recent years. A new donation of 19th-20th century studio ceramics, including late 20th century teapots by prominent British makers, has helped further to augment the outstanding teapot collection.</p>
<p>Current collecting has focused on acquiring a small number of objects of high quality only, with an emphasis on the filling of major gaps, identifying objects of particular relevance to the region, and contextualising items already in the collections. Recent significant acquisitions include a set of internationally important 16th century Norwich-made stained glass roundels, which form part of the Castle Keep&#8217;s display reflecting the city&#8217;s medieval wealth and prominence. By contrast, the most recent acquisition, a contemporary glass interpretation of the Norwich Snapdragon by a nationally known Norfolk-based maker will also be displayed in the Keep, making a connection between the medieval and modern worlds. These two acquisitions between them represent in microcosm a crucial aim of the Art Department&#8217;s collecting as a whole.</p>
<h3>Natural History</h3>
<p>Norwich Castle Museum &amp; Art Gallery maintains the major biological and geological collections in Norfolk Museums Service. As well as being of great local and regional significance the collections are Designated as nationally and internationally important.</p>
<p>The collections number about 1,500,000 specimens, covering all aspects of natural history and geology. Although mainly of East Anglian origin, the collections incorporate material from elsewhere in Britain, Europe and the rest of the world. The Natural History Department has a countywide role and in certain groups also acquires reference material from elsewhere in Britain and the rest of the world, but only where it is directly relevant to the existing collections.</p>
<p>The bird collections include several historically important specimens. The skins constitute an important British and European collection; they are often used for reference by artists and amateur and professional ornithologists. The Museum holds extensive egg collections of British and foreign birds numbering some 10,000 specimens, which are an important historical resource for scientists studying bird biology. From a scientific and conservation point of view it is material of the more common species that is most useful.</p>
<p>Among the mammals are important mounted specimens from Australia and Africa. There is a comprehensive collection of East Anglian mammals (skins and mounts) which are frequently used for education and research. The osteology collections are important as reference material for work on Pleistocene mammal remains.</p>
<p>Reptiles and amphibians are not well-represented in the collections (about 130 specimens). The 300 fish specimens are mainly of local origin.</p>
<p>Apart from the Fountaine-Neimy collection, the entomology includes several nationally important collections of British Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera and British and foreign Coleoptera and Hemiptera.</p>
<p>Modern invertebrate material includes marine, freshwater and terrestrial species, mainly from East Anglia, and constitutes the most comprehensive collection of East Anglian non-insect invertebrates. There are extensive collections of foreign shells.</p>
<p>The botany collections comprise mainly local material but also contain exchange specimens from elsewhere in Britain and smaller collections from abroad.</p>
<p>Of the many thousands of geological specimens, some are internationally important. These mostly reflect the geology of the county and therefore are largely fossils from the Chalk, Crag and Ice Age deposits. Highlights of the geology collection include bones, antlers and tusks from large vertebrates of the Cromer Forest Bed formation which outcrops around the coast of Norfolk and Suffolk, and the largest and most complete fossil elephant ever found in Britain, the West Runton elephant.</p>
<p>The archives include some 30,000 letters and 550 manuscript books relating to the collections and local naturalists. Among them are several 18th and early 19th century journals and notebooks. Other historical material held in the Department includes a small collection of microscopes, one of which is of great importance.</p>
<h3>Costume &amp; Textile</h3>
<p>The current collections number around 30,000 accessioned items, enhanced with a large 6,500 volume library and some 16,000 resources such as photographs, fashion plates and paper patterns. They consist of British costume and textiles including men&#8217;s, women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s dress, domestic and furnishing textiles and needlework tools, Religious dress and Norwich civic costume collections.</p>
<p>Areas of particular strength are accessories (especially shoes and shawls), working and sporting dress. There are several significant large collections of dress such as the Lady Fairhaven collection of 170 items of dress and accessories from a wealthy heiress, c18951935; the Maurice Walker collection of locally tailor-made suits, sporting dress and a city gentleman&#8217;s accessories, c1950-1990; and the Elizabeth Forster collection of knitted garments, patterns and archive of a knitwear designer from 1960-80.</p>
<p>The Costume &amp; Textiles Department collects only to enhance its specialist collections or to fill in gaps. For example, there is a photographic archive of everyday and sub-cultural dress in Norwich from 1985 to the present day which it uses as the basis for collecting dress from the past 30 years. Collecting continues to reflect changes in communities and society by adding recent examples to the working, religious and sporting dress. Also collected are examples of Norwich shawls and textiles (usually with grant assistance) and contemporary textiles which offer the opportunity to demonstrate a continuum of practice and highlight key themes seen in the textile techniques and teaching collections such as mending and making clothing.</p>
<h2>Museum of Norwich</h2>
<p>The collection comprises nearly 23,000 objects, ranging broadly from the 15th to late 20th centuries, with particular focus on the mid-19th to late 20th century.</p>
<p>Since the 1970s, the accessioned collections have focussed on the trades and industries of Norwich although, following on from the 2012 redevelopment project, the collection is broadening to include other elements of the city&#8217;s social history, for example collections linked to Norwich City Football Club. They have specific strengths in the Norwich boot and shoe trade, local industries such as textiles, engineering, food manufacture, printing and brewing as well as an extensive photographic library of local images. We are currently working in partnership with Picture Norfolk, part of Norfolk Library &amp; Information Service, to digitise the very best of these photographic collections.</p>
<p>The boots and shoes, Norwich textiles, metalwork and pharmacy collections are seen to be especially significant. The boot and shoe collections have developed most strongly over the past 20 years and will remain our primary collecting focus. The pharmacy collection is also highly regarded. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain regards it as a unique collection, unrivalled in other museums, and deems it as of national importance.</p>
<p>Star objects include the newly refurbished Jacquard loom, Barnard&#8217;s wire netting machine and the Shand Mason steam fire engine; and of course, the recreated pharmacy.</p>
<p>Many items in the new displays are drawn from the domestic collections from Stranger&#8217;s Hall Museum, as well as costume and textiles, art and decorative art collections from other NMS departments based at Shirehall, Norwich. All collections on display were strictly selected to fit the new focus of the museum, to show a more people focussed social history of the city, from its medieval roots to the present day.</p>
<p>The redevelopment project triggered a major collection relocation and latterly storage reorganisation programme. This includes the beginning of an ongoing rationalisation process, which has been identifying collections that fall outside of the museum&#8217;s city, rather than county, focus.</p>
<h2>Strangers&#8217; Hall</h2>
<p>The collections number some 25,000 items. The overall quality is high and they are particularly strong in traditional folk life collecting areas such as cooking, household and food preparation equipment, and childhood including toys, games, dolls and children&#8217;s books.</p>
<p>The collection as a whole includes large and small objects, photographs, magazines, and ephemera. Individual collections of note include the Brereton Collection of bedroom furnishings and textiles (with the textiles element in the care of the Costume &amp; Textile Department) and the Sarah Glover Collection relating a local pioneer&#8217;s development of [ends]</p>
<p>The collections have particular strengths in children&#8217;s books, especially the 18th and early 19th centuries and ‘ Golden Age&#8217; publications; and in dolls, with over 500 including one dating to the 1790s. The musical instrument collection contains rare instruments including a tenor cornett, a Bressan bass recorder and a horn by Nicholas Winkings. Other strong collections comprise valentines (including the Norwich tradition of &#8216;black valentines&#8217;), small personal equipment, writing equipment and home entertainment. The collections benefitted from the donation of significant fittings from demolished historic houses in Norwich.</p>
<p>A redisplay of early period rooms in 2006-07 to focus attention on the history of former owners of Strangers&#8217; Hall and its central place in the history of Norwich has involved the selective use of commissioned replica ceramics, tableware and Norwich textiles, which are not accessioned.</p>
<p>An ongoing programme of rationalisation has been identifying those objects which have no local provenance, are in poor condition, are duplicates or which have no identified research or display possibility.</p>
<h2>Royal Norfolk Regimental Museum</h2>
<p>The collection consists of approximately 16,500 items, divided into seven main categories:</p>
<p>uniforms; curios, issued equipment, souvenirs; firearms and edged weapons; prints, drawings and paintings; medals; photographs; archives.</p>
<p>The accessioned collection is focussed on the history of the Royal Norfolk Regiment from its formation as Colonel Cornwall&#8217;s Regiment in 1685 to its amalgamation with the Suffolk Regiment in 1959, the men who served in it and the places they served. It encompasses around 11,500 objects with a broad geographical spread and a particular focus on the First and Second World Wars. It has specific strengths in printed and manuscript archives, medals and photographs.</p>
<p>The collection meets the statement of purpose and key aims of the museum by informing and inspiring people&#8217;s interest in the history of the county regiment and the men who served in it . The range of material also enables people to understand and value other cultures. The collection is regularly used for family history and local history projects providing an enjoyable way to learn, enriching people&#8217;s lives and creating a sense of place and identity.</p>
<p>As well as the accessioned collection, there is an unaccessioned reference collection of information about individuals who served in the Regiment and a photographic survey of First World War Memorials in the county of Norfolk. As these collections contain copies, newspaper cuttings, references and survey photographs it is not appropriate to accession them.</p>
<h2>Gressenhall Farm &amp; Workhouse</h2>
<p>The accessioned collections are focussed on Norfolk&#8217;s rural life. They encompass around 60,000 objects with a broad geographical spread from across the county and a chronological span from the late 17th to the mid-20th century, with particular focus on the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<p>There are specific strengths in vernacular furniture, printed material, agricultural engineering, rural clothing, village shops and grass roots societies, in addition to the more obvious farming collections. The museum buildings, being a workhouse and associated farm, are also key collection items in themselves. Several of the museum&#8217;s specialist collections, for example in rural trades and union activity, are nationally significant. The collections clearly match the key aim of the museum to reflect the changing nature of Norfolk as a rural county.</p>
<p>A rationalisation programme is identifying a range of objects that sit outside the museum&#8217;s current collecting policy, mainly duplicate items or those in poor condition or which have no Norfolk connection, but there are no significant parts of the collection that are not relevant to the museum&#8217;s purpose.</p>
<p>Some historical items, such as those related to the working farm, object handling or set dressing are not accessioned as their use implies they will eventually be discarded due to wear and tear. Such items are duplicates of those in the main collection and/or have no connection to Norfolk or wider national significance. The museum always ensures donors of objects used in this way are clear that the donated objects are not part of its accessioned collections.</p>
<h2>Lynn Museum</h2>
<p>Lynn Museum holds a diverse collection of over 50,000 objects. Strengths of the collection include the poster and photographic collections, the Henry Baines and Walter Dexter archives, the Savages collection, costumes and textiles, Medieval pilgrim badges and the collection of Lynn glass.</p>
<p>Lynn Museum houses the Early Bronze Age timber circle Seahenge, which was discovered in 1998 on Holme beach. While it is on long-term loan and is not an accessioned object, the Bronze Age is an area of development and the museum actively collects items that contextualise Seahenge. For example, in 2014 the museum acquired a middle Bronze Age gold penannular composite ring for this purpose.</p>
<p>The museum also possesses several handling collections that overlap with accessioned objects. These are used in educational activities to engage and inspire.</p>
<p>The museum is currently undergoing a large digitisation project; it has fully digitised the photographic collection and is in the process of digitising the Savages collection and the Baines and Dexter archives. Another major project is the re-creation of the 1980s Lynn photographic survey, re-taking the photos in present-day Lynn.</p>
<h2>Ancient House Museum</h2>
<p>Ancient House holds over 7000 objects, mainly of local significance with some items of regional if not national importance. Strengths of the collection include the Frederick Duleep Singh collection of fine art, which contains portraits of national importance; the Maharajah Duleep Singh collection; items relating to Thomas Paine; Thetford pulpware; the flint knapping collection; material from early excavations at the internationally important Neolithic flint mines Grimes Graves; and records relating to the 20th century Town Expansion scheme.</p>
<p>The museum also possesses several handling collections, used in activities to encourage learning. These handling collections have some overlap with the accessioned collection but also includes social history objects with no particular Thetford links.</p>
<p>With the help of regular volunteers, Ancient House is currently in the process of digitising its collections.</p>
<h2>Cromer Museum</h2>
<p>The museum collection has grown since 1978 within the control of a well-defined collecting policy. It now stretches to over 18,000 photographs, objects, documents and books. The archive covers the story of Cromer form geological times through the middle ages and its Victorian heyday up to modern times.</p>
<p>In 2008 the museum acquired a collection of almost 2,000 images by the Edwardian North Norfolk photographer Olive Edis. This represents the biggest collection of her work in the world and attracts the largest number of enquiries to the collection. The museum also boasts a fine collection of North Norfolk Ganseys which have also attracted attention from across the globe</p>
<p>In addition to the accessioned collection there is further quantity of ephemera and a number of small but significant handling collections relating to geology and social history that are used for educational purposes as well as museum events. These handling collections are made of items that duplicate better examples in the core collections.</p>
<h2>Great Yarmouth Museums</h2>
<p>The accessioned collections are largely focused on Great Yarmouth&#8217;s local history with a strong leaning towards maritime collections. All of the Great Yarmouth museums are situated in listed buildings. Each museum tells the story of a different period in the town&#8217;s history and the buildings are collection items in themselves. Time &amp; Tide Museum is located in a renovated Victorian herring curing works, the Tolhouse is a 12th century gaol and courthouse, and the Elizabethan House was built in 1596.</p>
<p>The collection encompasses around 30,000 objects and paintings, as well as a maritime archive of approximately 20,000 photographs and documents. The wide-ranging maritime collection concentrates on fishing, shipbuilding and other maritime trades, merchant trade and lifesaving in Great Yarmouth. The emphasis is on herring fishing and curing from the last two centuries, but the collection as a whole covers archaeology from the Ice Age and ethnography, right up to objects from the 1990s.</p>
<p>The museum holds a comprehensive archive of photographs, plans and charts, research files and a database of Yarmouth registered vessels. The collection&#8217;s strengths include photographs and shipbuilding plans and objects relating to herring fishing, and meets the key aims of Time &amp; Tide Museum to reflect the diverse nature of maritime Norfolk generally and Great Yarmouth specifically.</p>
<p>A current rationalisation programme is identifying a range of objects that sit outside the museum&#8217;s current collecting policy, mainly duplicate items or those in poor condition and/or with no Norfolk or maritime connection to Great Yarmouth. However there are no large parts of the collection that are no longer relevant to our purpose.</p>

				     	<p>The museums which compose Nottingham City Museums &amp; Galleries have been acquiring objects since before 1867 when the Natural History museum was established. The collections range across many disciplines; Costume and Textiles (with an emphasis on lace), Decorative and Fine Art, Antiquities and Archaeology, Social and Industrial history, world cultures and items associated with Newstead Abbey (especially those relating to the poet &#8211; 6th Lord Byron). Also collected are all aspects of Natural History; Geology, Zoology and Botany. Many items have a strong local ( and Nottinghamshire) provenance. The city&#8217;s collection currently consists of over 100,000 humanities objects and in excess of half a million natural history specimens.</p>

				     	<h2>HUMANITIES</h2>
<h3>Costume &amp; Textiles</h3>
<p>The has collected lace since before it opened in 1878, this being the principal manufacturing industry for which the town was world famous. The initial aim was to provide inspiration for designers and to put local textiles, particularly lace, into a world-wide historical context. From the early 1960&#8217;s onwards costume was collected with the aim, eventually fulfilled in 1973, of opening a dedicated museum (closed 2003).</p>
<p>There are five main collections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lace: machine-made and hand-made: <strong>Designated</strong> in 2014, along with the associated machinery (q.v.); a nationally significant collection with unrivalled coverage of machine-made lace including the earliest known surviving pieces dating to 1768. This is adequately contextualised by a good selection of hand-made lace and costume made or trimmed with lace additionally supported by an excellent selection of lace machinery in the Industrial collection. There are over 8000 records for lace but this represents in excess of 50,000 samples as many are contained within manufacturers pattern books.</li>
<li>Costume: men&#8217;s, women&#8217;s, children&#8217;s c.1700 onwards comprising over 12,000 items, the majority being higher status women&#8217;s clothing as that is what commonly survives – material is not specifically local as there was no &#8220;regional&#8221; style.</li>
<li>Embroideries: The collection has some 2000 items incorporating &#8220;needlework&#8221;. 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> century embroidery is well represented by the superb Middleton Collection (on loan to the castle museum since 1883). A large selection of 19<sup>th</sup> century samplers has been acquired.</li>
<li>Textiles: woven, printed, knitted: was a hosiery centre before it was a lace centre and products of it stocking frames have been actively sought.</li>
<li>Non-British costume and textiles (responsibility for curation of purely ethnographic material now passed to World Cultures)</li>
<li>In addition there are six subsidiary collections:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Accessories carried in the hand or on the person</li>
<li>Accessories connected with the putting on, taking off and care of costumes</li>
<li>Tools used in needlework, textile crafts and home industries</li>
<li>Source material: fashion books and plates, magazines, photographs</li>
<li>Dolls and dolls&#8217; clothing</li>
<li>Furniture (closed – had been acquired solely for dressing room sets at the Costume museum, much now disposed of)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Decorative Art</h3>
<p>A rich resource containing some of the Museum&#8217;s finest items. Objects were acquired from 1873 onwards under Henry Cole&#8217;s founding vision to inspire local designers – these ceramics, glass, metalwork, furniture and jewellery, are part of the history of design as well of craftsmanship and are becoming increasingly important for their social historical context.</p>
<p>The majority of pieces date from the 17th century onwards though there are a few (46) mainly late medieval items, mostly pottery. The collection covers a wide range of hand-made and industrially made domestic, household and personal objects of mainly British origin with some significant European and a handful of Oriental items.</p>
<p>There are five main collections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ceramics: Pottery comprises over half the collection. Significant elements are the Salt-glaze stoneware which has a close association with and the Wedgwood collection (1400 pieces of jasperware). Alongside the Ballantyne loan collection active collecting of contemporary studio pottery has continued since the early 1980s.</li>
<li>Glass: 612 glass items principally 19th Century Venetian and 18th Century English. Comparable collections of Venetian (Salviati) glass are found only in Edinburgh, Paris and Berlin.</li>
<li>Metalwork: dating from the 17th century onwards, the 282 British items include work in a variety of different metals including silver, iron, pewter etc. The precious metalwork is limited to silver and silver gilt – the most important being the Gibbs collection of Georgian domestic silver. The wrought iron gates etc. have strong local provenance.</li>
<li>Jewellery: 423 pieces mainly British and European jewellery dating mainly from the 17th century to the present day. It consists primarily of &#8220;designer&#8221; jewellery, but also includes some costume jewellery.</li>
<li>Contemporary crafts: around 200 objects incorporating many aspects of the above with works by important British designers of the past 30 years</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three subsidiary collections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clocks, watches and barometers: Locally manufactured pieces (214).</li>
<li>Furniture and woodwork. A small selection of 17<sup>th</sup> &#8211; 19<sup>th</sup> century British and Continental furniture, displayed as part of room sets at Wollaton Hall and Newstead Abbey. Woodwork – there are panels, bench ends, boxes, parts of screens and beams a number of which are of local significance</li>
<li>Small decorative objects (tortoiseshell, enamel, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fine Art</h3>
<p>Founded on large bequests, this collection ranges across British and European oil paintings, water-colours, drawings, prints and sculpture. Works date from the 11th century to the present day. The following are the main collecting themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alabaster Carvings; though only few in number (21) this is the most important collection of such sculpture outside of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. Nottingham is strongly associated with the manufacture and trade in alabasters in the 14th and 15th centuries.</li>
<li>European (Non-British) Oil Paintings (109); mostly Dutch and Northern European it has a good representative selection of genre, still-life and landscape works – of particular local importance is Jan Siberechts&#8217; <em>View of Nottingham from the East </em>[NCM 1977-515]</li>
<li>British Art 1700-1900, the majority of the collection falls into this category represented by over 4000 oils, watercolours, etchings, drawings, prints etc. It includes some 155 examples of the works of the born artists Thomas and Paul Sandby. Richard Parkes Bonington is represented by 140 works. Landscapes include examples of the work of Wilson, Barrett, Turner, Girtin and Cotman and a small group of oils by George Morland.</li>
<li>Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Topography and work by Local Artists. Responsibility is currently divided between Social History (800) and Fine Art (169) the former holding items primarily of historical interest. The latter has the only major public collection of works by significant artists of the 19th and 20th centuries; Thomas Barber, John Rawson Walker and Henry Dawson. It also tells the story of the rise of as a provincial art centre.</li>
<li>Modern and Contemporary Works. Over 500 works including important pieces by William Nicholson his son Ben and Ben&#8217;s wife Winifred; oil paintings and works on paper by locally born artist Dame Laura Knight; representative pieces of the modernist school by Edward Burra, Edward Wadsworth and Tristram Hillier and a selection of pieces by Mathew Smith, L.S. Lowry, Ivon Hitchens and Stanley Spencer along with a small group of sculptures by Jacob Epstein. Recently significant collections of Fine Art Photography and Textiles and items of contemporary sculpture have been acquired through participation in the Contemporary Art Society &#8220;Special collections scheme&#8221; and through the Society&#8217;s &#8220;Commission to Collect&#8221; Award.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Human History</h3>
<p>&#8220;Archaeological specimens and relics&#8221; were listed among the &#8220;objects desired&#8221; by the in 1878, building on a small but important collection of medieval pottery donated to the Midland Counties Art Exhibition in 1874. With rare exceptions (Nemi and ) the present collections resulted from chance finds, gifts or purchases from collectors. They now consist of several major collecting areas; archaeology, numismatics, military, arms and armour, locks and keys. The most significant collections are those of artefacts from the at Nemi, local archaeology and numismatics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Archaeology (international); of at Nemi near the collection of 1612 objects (principally votives, coins and architectural fragments) is of outstanding importance for the study of early Roman religion – several of the exhibits are internationally famous.</li>
<li>Archaeology (local); 6232 records including lower Palaeolithic groups (important evidence for settlement in the ,<em> c.</em> 200,000 years ago). The finest collection of Bronze Age weapons in the Midlands, nearly all from the near Nottingham – also two log boats from . Significant early Anglo-Saxon material includes grave goods from and pottery from the earliest settlement of . Late Saxon and medieval finds from , especially the site of and Castle. Medieval and early post-medieval pottery, regionally very important and one of the best collections in . 214 recent Archaeological Site Archives have or will be deposited.</li>
<li>Numismatics; 8467 items of which coins (7057), local tokens (396) and medals (843) are the principal elements. Local Roman and Medieval hoards form the backbone of the coin collections.</li>

<li>Locks and Keys; (351) A remarkably comprehensive collection from the Roman period to early 20th century it contain items of great rarity. Mostly given by a local collector. It includes many high quality local, British, European and non-European examples.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Industry &amp; Technology</h3>
<p>The collecting of industrial objects began with the acquisition of lace machinery items in 1878. By the 1970s&#8217; the collecting base was very broad and covered a wide range of technological subjects (not exclusively of local interest) and a separate museum had been opened to house them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lace Machinery; 700 plus items – part of the <strong>Designated</strong> collection, it has some of the earliest lace machinery built in the country including models by John Heathcoat and John Leavers. Other lace machines built in are held along with associated equipment used in the various processes of lace-making.</li>
<li>Hosiery and Machine Knitting; a small collection of 73 items including stocking frames from which the earliest lace machines were derived. Collecting is restricted to items with strong local significance.</li>
<li>Transport, Bicycles; 300 objects with special emphasis on the company of and including the associated firm of Sturmey Archer. A number of cycles of other makes are held to show general technological development.</li>
<li>Telecommunications; representing the development of the telephone to the present day. Mainly products made by the Ericsson/Plessey company of Beeston (). The collection also includes exchanges, engineers&#8217; equipment and telegraphy material. There is a large archive comprising Ericsson&#8217;s collection of glass negatives, photographs, design drawings, in-house journals and press material (571 items).</li>
<li>Tobacco Industry; large machinery used to manufacture cigarettes in Nottingham. Cigarette vending machines are also held.</li>
<li>Transport: Cars, Motorcycles; comprised of a number of made cars and motorcycles. The car collection has a unique 1904 Celer, a Raleigh Safety Seven and a Brough Superior saloon. The motorcycle collection includes machines by Raleigh, Campion and Brough.</li>
<li>Business Machinery; This consists chiefly of a collection of typewriters (134) from the 1890s&#8217; to 1970s&#8217;. The Nottingham firm of Bar-Lock is well represented although there are examples from most of the larger typewriter manufacturers in Nottingham.</li>
<li>Pharmaceuticals; Manufacturing equipment made and used by the Boots company and other local chemical manufacturing firms.</li>
<li>Engineering; Machine Tools, Mechanical engineering, Civil engineering and Prime Movers – the last category having the largest item in the collection, the Basford Beam Engine.</li>
<li>Printing; A number of different types of printing presses are held in this collection which has special reference to the H.S. Cropper and Cropper Charlton companies of Nottingham. Other items held are associated with the industry – 184 items.</li>
</ul>
<p>Subsidiary collections contain items relating to electrical and precision engineering, domestic photography, domestic electrical equipment, agriculture, coal mining, smithing, time keeping, woodworking and waterways.</p>
<h3>Newstead Abbey</h3>
<p>The collections at Newstead Abbey have been determined by the history of the house and its inhabitants. Founded as an Augustinian priory, following the Dissolution the estate was acquired by the Byron family. In 1818 the property was sold by the 6th Lord Byron to Thomas Wildman. Acquired by William Webb in 1861 ownership passed to his grandson Charles Ian Fraser who sold Newstead to Sir Julien Cahn for presentation to Nottingham Corporation in 1931. From then until 1973 the Abbey was administered by the City Librarian. The central themes of the collection are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Newstead Priory; archival and archaeological material.</li>
<li>Byron Family; archival material, furniture, paintings, family portraits, memorabilia.</li>
<li>6th Lord Byron; memorabilia including furniture, books, correspondence portraits, pictures, prints, costume and other personal belongings and documents. Prominent amongst these are; the Pigot Collection containing autograph letters from Byron to members of the Pigot family, all dating from his adolescence and early manhood in Nottinghamshire and the 1937 Roe-Byron Collection of more than 1200 items. Consisting of books, manuscripts, pictures, prints and other material relating to the poet – a unique record of the state of Byron scholarship to 1923. It contains one of only four known copies of the poet&#8217;s first published book, <em>Fugitive Pieces.</em></li>
<li>Wildman and Webb Families; portraits, books, furniture, armour, pictures, prints, photographs, correspondence, household accounts and visitors&#8217; books, also the Goodlake Collection of Crimean War memorabilia.</li>
<li>Architectural and Garden History of Newstead; prints, pictures, drawings, architectural plans and elevations, correspondence and other archival material.</li>
<li>History of the Newstead Estate; archival material including estate maps, site plans, sale catalogues, manuscripts and correspondence.</li>
<li>Historic interiors; in order to interpret Newstead Abbey as an historic house a programme for the recreation of the interiors was initiated. Efforts have been made to acquire furniture, furnishings, fittings, decorations etc. known to be original to the house (or items sufficiently similar). Also documentary evidence of the historic interiors, such as drawings, water-colours, photographs, inventories and other contemporary descriptions. Together these form around 1/10<sup>th</sup> of the collection.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Social History</h3>
<p>A large, broad and diverse collection of around 30,000 objects the purpose of which is to illustrate the rich and varied history of Nottingham and its people from 1600 to the present day. Items of social historical interest had accumulated at the Castle since 1878. Subsequently collected systematically from the late 1960s&#8217; efforts culminated with the opening of a dedicated museum at Brewhouse yard in 1977. The bulk of the collections held cover the period<em> </em>1870-1950 with &#8220;greater &#8221; the geographical focus. They can be broadly categorized under four headings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Community Life (including Nottingham and Nottinghamshire, religion, calendar customs, rites of passage, government, law and order, education, organizations, wartime, newspapers and topographical views).</li>
<li>Domestic Life (buildings, cooking, furnishings, fixtures, gardening, heating, housekeeping, laundering, pastimes, sport and sanitation)</li>
<li>Personal Life (including child rearing, medical, finance, personal records, reading and writing, smoking and tobacco, shaving and personal toilet)</li>
<li>Working Life (items relating to work which is hand-powered and workshop-based – as opposed to machine-powered and factory-based as collected by Industry). Trades and professions are well represented by objects ranging in scale from small items to entire shops; Architects, baking, brewing, chemists, dentists, hair dressers etc. Also collected are the end products of many local firms. A notable collection is the large &#8220;John Player tobacco Advertising Archive&#8221; of packaging, point-of-sale and press advertising, posters, promotional material, original artwork, etc. relating to the products of the firm from the 19th century to the 1980s&#8217;.</li>
</ul>
<h3>World Cultures</h3>
<p>Nottingham museums hold over 4,500 ethnographical items – the largest such collection in the East Midlands. The collections are varied and contain much good material. However representation is somewhat unbalanced reflecting individual collectors interests in specific aspects (such as weapons and pottery). Significant amongst these collectors is local antiquarian W.J. Thompson. The largest groups are from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nigeria; 286 items (including 100 early pottery vessels), most acquired from an unknown source in 1878.</li>
<li>The Pacific; Oceania etc. approximately 1000 pieces received mainly from W. Fillingham-Parr in 1887 and W.J. Thompson in 1952 – paddles, clubs spears and arrow heads being strongly represented</li>
<li>India; collecting commenced with the purchase of fine Indian leather and metalwork ( workshops) from the 1878 Paris Exhibition.</li>
<li>Burma; mainly Buddhist figurines acquired in 1889.</li>
<li>China; fine silks transferred from <em>Costume &amp; Textiles</em>.</li>
<li>Japan; around 500 pieces – chiefly the Japanese arms and armour given in 1921 by Sir Frank Bowden.</li>
<li>Peru; 200 pieces of Chimu pottery once thought to date from 800-1532 subsequent research has indicated a far more recent origin is likely.</li>
<li>North America; 244 items representing some of the indigenous North American Nations of the USA and Canada.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Wollaton Hall</h3>
<p>A small collection of items relating directly to the Grade 1 listed Hall, buildings and estate. This includes fixtures (wall paintings on the Hall North and South Stairs) the 18<sup>th</sup> century Organ, curtain rails, candelabra and architectural &#8220;salvage&#8221; (e.g. fireplaces removed during the conversion of the hall to a Museum in 1926).</p>
<h2>NATURAL HISTORY COLLECTIONS</h2>
<p>The Natural History Museum was founded in 1867 as the town&#8217;s first public museum. The collections were used as the basis for the teaching of natural history at the (established shortly thereafter) and as such were developed to include examples from all the major animal, plant and geological groups. This has led to NCMG having one of the most comprehensive of regional collections. The link with university was severed with the removal of the collection to storage and subsequently the establishment of a dedicated Natural History Museum at Wollaton Hall in 1926. It finally joined with the in 1952.</p>
<h3>Geology (Rocks, Minerals Fossils)</h3>
<p>Comprising 50,000 fossils, 4,000 minerals, 3,500 rocks. A comprehensive collection of British fossils and rocks and minerals from around the world &#8211; the geology collections has been a major component of the Natural History Museum since its creation. Several large, high quality acquisitions greatly augmented the collection during 1870s&#8217; when the Carrington, Mello and Hollier fossil collections were added. Further important fossil collections from Rev. Chamberlin (British Fossils) and Professor Swinnerton (Permo-Triassic footprints) came In the 20th century.</p>
<p>The mineral collections were amassed from individual purchases from the early 1880s; the Davy mineral and later the Gilman rock and mineral collections were added early in the 20th century, and the useful Crowther mineral collection was donated in 1954. Strengths of the collection are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nottinghamshire Upper Carboniferous plant fossils; this is a very important collection as complete plant fossils are now very rare because of mechanized quarrying methods.</li>
<li>Nottinghamshire Permo-Triassic reptile/amphibian footprints.</li>
<li>Nottinghamshire Lower Jurassic vertebrate fossils.</li>
<li>British Carboniferous Coal and Silurian fossils.</li>
<li>Nottinghamshire Pleistocene animal and plant fossils, including the famous cave deposit specimens from Creswell and Pleasley.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Vertebrate Zoology</h3>
<p>The Museum has &#8220;a very fine collection of display mounts and taxidermy.&#8221; Over 6,000 individual vertebrate specimens ranging from complete horse skeletons to small bat skulls. The majority are mounts, study skins or osteological preparations but some are preserved in spirit. Around 80%, are from overseas, with 20% from and . Some specimens were given to us by the (Natural History). Also acquired was a sizeable collection of vertebrate material from the Royal Liverpool Institute in the 1890s&#8217;. In the 1920s&#8217; the museum acquired the Mansfield Parkyns collection of Ethiopian birds dating from the 1840s; and in 1945 the &#8220;Welbeck Collection&#8221; of mounted birds. Many individual specimens were bought from the best taxidermist companies, such as Rowland Ward and Edward Gerrard.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<ul>
<li>Birds; this collection is especially varied and includes many high quality diorama displays.</li>
<li>Local fish mounts and dioramas; important to the local angling community because they include several important angling records.</li>
<li>Large African Mammals including Cheetah, Leopard, Giraffe and Gorilla.</li>
<li>Extinct species; such as the Passenger Pigeon and many rare species which are now impossible to obtain such as the Duck-billed Platypus, Argus Pheasant, Kakapo, Kiwi, Kea etc.</li>
<li>Birds&#8217; eggs collections, in excess of 16,500 specimens, containing British, European and local material, some of which contain items from lost great collections.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Invertebrate Zoology (Insects)</h3>
<p>340,000 specimens (65% British &amp; European, 35% foreign). The Fowler, Hunter and Carr collections are nationally important. In general a very comprehensive collection covering most groups however local collections are incomplete at the species level, and the world-wide collections are incomplete at the family level in some groups and in geographical and habitat coverage. Strengths of the collection are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Examples from many famous collectors, travellers and international experts especially from the 19th century.</li>
<li>The Fowler Coleoptera collection is significant because Canon Fowler wrote the standard work on British Beetles in the 1880s, with many of the illustrations based on specimens from this large collection. The original illustrations are also held.</li>
<li>Crowfoot Lepidoptera collection includes many rare specimens.</li>
<li>The British and Nottinghamshire Hymenoptera and the Hunter Diptera collections are especially good for a non-national museum.</li>
<li>The Nottinghamshire collections of most orders are a permanent record of the wildlife found in the county over the years.</li>
<li>The systematic display collections are still of interest as they set British and European species in the context of their foreign counterparts.</li>
<li>The Bragg collection of Stick Insects is noteworthy because it represents the work of a locally-based international expert in the field.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Invertebrate Zoology (Non-insect)</h3>
<p>52,000 specimens (10% British &amp; European, 90% foreign). A comprehensive local and world-wide collection of shells (which along with beetles and butterflies, were one of the main enthusiasms of Victorian naturalists) plus a moderately comprehensive collection of spiders and other arachnids. Again the original teaching purpose of the collection has ensured that there are at least a few examples of many of the animal groups within this section.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nottinghamshire molluscs, including specimens from C.T. Musson, the county&#8217;s shell expert in the 19th century;</li>
<li>J.W. Carr&#8217;s collections Nottinghamshire spiders and other invertebrates which support many of his own field records;</li>
<li>Marshall Collection of shells, which includes British species, importantly – and unusually – in all stages of development, and world-wide species from Africa, the Caribbean, Asia and Australia;</li>
<li>The Pitchford collection of British shells.</li>
<li>Blaschka glass models of coral, jellyfish and other marine invertebrates acquired 1887-1890 from the famous father and son team of Rudolf and Leopold Blaschka of Dresden.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Botany</h3>
<p>Originating with field collections, themselves augmented through exchange with other botanists around the country, also by donation and purchase. This was supplemented by much field collecting throughout the and by the Curator Professor Carr, especially from Nottinghamshire. Most of the Botany collections are significant and they include the important Carr and Fisher Antarctic material and some early herbaria. At least 100,000 specimens (roughly 65% British &amp; European, 35% foreign), a very comprehensive collection of flowering plants, ferns, mosses, fungi, algae and seaweeds, etc. from Nottinghamshire and around the world.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early herbaria; Edward Lhwyd&#8217;s herbarium and a ‘Hortus Siccus&#8217;. made by Richard Newdigate both dating to the 1690s.</li>
<li>Carr herbarium of Nottinghamshire plants, a well provenanced collection closely linked to Carr&#8217;s records and unpublished flora and mostly collected by him.</li>
<li>British herbarium, a comprehensive collection of most British plant species, including many Irish locations.</li>
<li>The E.M. Holmes Collection of Lichens is comprehensive and of increasing value as lichens start to recolonize areas such as Nottinghamshire.</li>
<li>The Fisher herbarium covers Nottingham, Nottinghamshire and much of the British Isles, and is notable for the extensive bramble and rose section which is of increasing interest to plant geneticists (supported by notebooks).</li>
<li>Fisher material includes Arctic specimens collected during the Jackson-Harmsworth Arctic expedition of the 1890s.</li>
<li>Foreign Herbarium, holds many specimens from Europe and around the world, mostly as typical species from several continents, containing material from foreign dealers and botanists this collection contains specimens back to the 1790s.</li>
</ul>
<h2>SUPPORT COLLECTIONS</h2>
<p>Objects of all types which are not part of the permanent collections but are acquired or produced to support public or museum activities such as handling sessions, furnishing for displays and reproductions or for reference purposes. Most departments have a quantity of such items – the largest belongs to Social History which classifies over one third of its collection as &#8220;NAS&#8221; (Non-accessioned stock). It is recognized that these objects may have a limited life span or relevance to the Museum and their long term retention may be uneconomic. Therefore objects acquired for these purposes are accounted for separately and not necessarily subject to the high standards of care and documentation that govern the treatment of objects in the permanent collections.</p>
<h3>School Loans collection</h3>
<p>This collection came to Nottingham Museums from the local education authority in 2003. The majority of the collection is un-provenanced and is neither Accessioned or Registered. It is administered by the Learning &amp; Engagement team as &#8220;Access Artefacts&#8221;. Themes include: Community, Domestic, family and working life, Ethnography and Natural History.</p>

				     	<h2>Beginning of the Collection</h2>
<p>Lancaster University was founded by Royal Charter in 1964 and moved to its purpose-built campus in 1967, moving from its original site within Lancaster City Centre. From the early 1970s LU began building an art collection. This activity was primarily guided by the University&#8217;s ‘Embellishment Committee&#8217; – which acted on behalf of the University to make the campus more appealing to the public and its growing student population. This committee, and the development of art acquisitions, was primarily driven by Michael Argles, a library staff member and unofficially the first curator before the gallery was fully formed. Other committee members included university academic and non-academic staff, and student members. The most notable are: HRH Princess Alexandra (Chancellor), Sir Charles Frederick Carter (Vice Chancellor), Peter Shepherd (who conducted artist proposals and focused on campus sculpture), Peter F. Scott CBE (acting chairman, in the absence of the Vice Chancellor, and later patron/namesake of PSG), and a circulating entourage of artists who submitted proposals and advised the committee.</p>
<p>The art collection mainly consisted of works by contemporary British artists, and acquisition was made both by purchase and commission. This collection comprised mainly artists&#8217; original prints, with some oil paintings, watercolours, and a small number of public realm sculptures through residencies under the aegis of the Granada fellowship programme. The bulk of works in the collection dating from this period were associated with two specific areas: The North West of England; and Cornwall (artists associated with St. Ives). Towards the end of the 1970s the Embellishment Committee ceased to function, and focus shifted to estate management and design features rather than art commissions or purchases.</p>
<p>The earliest form of the PSG, or the Scott Gallery as it was then known, opened in 1974 at the southern end of the campus in Pendle College (occupying the building&#8217;s roof space). Showcasing items bought by the embellishments committee, touring exhibitions from private galleries and student art &amp; design shows. The gallery was given its first committed staff member in 1983 – Helen Brown, as an Exhibitions Organiser for three years until Mary Gavagan became the gallery&#8217;s first official curator from 1986 to 2009. Following 2009, PSG became part of the university&#8217;s integrated professional arts organisation alongside the Nuffield Theatre and the Concert Series based at the Great Hall. This would become LA. The gallery moved to its present location within the Great Hall Complex on the North side of the campus in 1988, becoming the Peter Scott Gallery.</p>
<p>In 2001, the Peter Scott Gallery Charitable Trust was established with Lord Shuttleworth as Chair for the following 18 years. A portion of the collection (the Irene Manton bequest – see below) was transferred by the University to the Trust, with the University retaining direct ownership over the remainder. Both collections have continued to grow and are managed together by Lancaster Arts on behalf of the University, under terms set out in an agreement between the University and the Trust. The Peter Scott Gallery has been an Accredited Museum since 2010.</p>
<h2>The Irene Manton Bequest</h2>
<p>In 1988 LU received a substantial collection – the Irene Manton Bequest. This group of paintings and prints was augmented in 1995 by the transfer of further works that formerly belonged to Professor Manton, which had been held at Leeds University since her death. These works complemented LU&#8217;s existing collection, as most of the works in the Bequest were artists&#8217; original prints, reflecting Professor Manton&#8217;s particular interest in prints and printmaking. Some interesting examples included are works by: Jean Arp&#8217;s <em>Gathering of Forms</em> (1966), Eduardo Chillida&#8217;s series of prints <em>for Le Chemin des Devins&#8217; </em><em>suivi</em><em> de &#8216;</em><em>Menerbes</em> (1966), the illustrated book <em>Constellations</em> with one lithograph and twenty-two pochoir reproductions after gouache works by Joan Miró (1959), two prints by Ben Shahn <em>Decalogue</em> (1960) and <em>Pleiades</em> (1960), the <em>Hommage</em><em> au Carre</em> series by Joseph Albers (1964), and many more.<em> </em>With this large bequest a more international collection was formed.</p>
<p>In addition to the collection of artists&#8217; original prints, other groups which can be identified within the collection are:</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese paintings and prints: this part of the bequest includes examples of seventeenth century Chinese art as well as works by twentieth century Chinese artists. Manton first began to collect art after visiting an exhibition of Chinese Art at the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 1935. As a scientist she was particularly interested in the detailed studies of nature produced by Chinese artists. Works in this collection include scroll and fan paintings, ink rubbings, and prints.</p>
<p>A small antiquities collection (79 items) – see below for further information.</p>
<p>Archival documents relating to Irene Manton.</p>
<h2>The Chambers Gift &amp; Bequest</h2>
<p>In 1994 LU was given a substantial ceramics collection. The collection comprises over 300 items of Royal Lancastrian Pottery donated by Miss Mary Chambers (19102002), on behalf of herself and her brother Arthur Chambers. In August 2002 the museum received a substantial bequest of archive material from Miss Mary Chambers. Miss Chambers was the daughter of John Chambers (1869-1945), who was the Chief Designer at Pilkington&#8217;s Tile and Pottery Company during what is generally considered to be its golden era (1898-1918). Among the thousands of items in the bequest were delicate illustrations and designs, posters, architectural plans, photographs, rare books and catalogues, diaries, paperwork, stencils for tiles, artists&#8217; materials, and ceramics.</p>
<p>Artists featured within the archive are Alphonse Mucha, Walter Crane, Lewis F. Day, C. F. A. Voysey, as well as notable works by artists who were employed by Pilkington&#8217;s. Overall, the Chambers Collection (comprising of 17,497 objects approx.) is of national significance due to its varied and rich nature, unknown works by famous creators and the stories it highlights.</p>
<h2>Gifts Made by A Donor Who Wished to Remain Anonymous (19932006)</h2>
<p>Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s the University received generous donations of art from a donor who resided in Morecambe. The donor wished to remain anonymous in their generous contribution to the collection. The artworks received comprised mainly of works by the Darwen born artist James Hargreaves Morton (1881-1918), otherwise known as the ‘Cotton-town impressionist&#8217;. There were single works by the artists: Francis Dodd, Ben Nelson, Harold Sutton-Palmer, Albert</p>
<p>Goodwin, Joseph Knight, Sidney Filmore, Dorothy Apted, Muirhead Bone, and Arthur Briscoe, totalling approximately over 130 works. The gifts significantly strengthened the representation of artists from the north of England, bolstering regional significance, and extended the temporal range of the collection to include the 19<sup>th</sup> century as well as the early 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<h2>Acquisitions and gifts in the Twenty-First Century</h2>
<p>Both the University owned collection and the PSGCT owned collection have continued to grow through gifts and acquisitions over the past two decades. This has included substantial gifts of contemporary art into the PSGCT owned collection via the Contemporary Art Society&#8217;s Museum member scheme (Peter Liversidge 2018, Sena Başöz 2022), as well as acquisitions of work from artists involved in Lancaster Arts&#8217; contemporary combined arts programme. Occasional gifts to the University have included further items of Pilkington&#8217;s pottery.</p>

				     	<h2>Paintings, drawings, prints and photography</h2>
<h3>Paintings &amp; Watercolours</h3>
<p>There are over 300 watercolours and paintings in the collection. They vary in style from European modernist examples of abstraction (Wilhelmina Barns-Graham&#8217;s ‘Oblong Cobalt Blue on Violet&#8217; [1969] and Luigi Pericle&#8217;s ‘Grated Jadegate&#8217; [1962] for example) to more representational landscape, portrait and still life painting. The paintings in the collection vary in size and technique, with some measuring at nearly 6ft high to others being made on scrolls or fans. The geographic locus is varied, including Europe, Asia, North America with some sparse material from Africa. A primary theme in some of the European paintings is the attention to form and colour, many having at times a ‘cellular&#8217;/organic appearance which may have been what drew Irene Manton&#8217;s eye when collecting these pieces.</p>
<p>Some paintings/watercolours are held in sketchbooks (Norman Adams and E.E. Clarke) and are prime examples of each artist&#8217;s work – especially of the North West and Northern England.</p>
<h3>Collage</h3>
<p>There are a small number of collage works within the collection, including pieces by William Tucker, Lee Strasburger, and Theresa Bajenko.</p>
<h3>Drawings</h3>
<p>The drawings in the collection span a variety of media including graphite, ink and charcoal, and include both European and Chinese and Japanese examples. Depictions of landscapes and nature from the North West are particularly strongly represented through the collection of James Hargreaves Morton&#8217;s works. Morton&#8217;s drawings comprise mainly of scenic views of the Darwen and Blackburn area, particularly of the Pennines and moorlands. There are also drawings of rural life, pastoral scenes and farm animals.</p>
<p>The drawings found in the Norman Adams Sketchbook(s) and E.E. Clarke collection within the Chamber&#8217;s Archive, both created in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, are numerous and depict views of Yorkshire (Ribblesdale &amp; Douk Ghyll, and Gordale Scar specifically – Adams), The Lake District (Clarke) and Italy (Clarke, again).</p>
<p>In the minority within the collection are drawings of urban life. The drawings by Lowry and Lynton Lamb, Tsung Yu, Cliff Rowe and Muirhead Bone are the few examples of cities and towns within the drawings collection.</p>
<p>A small minority of drawings are of figures associated with the university and of buildings on campus (Grizedale College).</p>
<h3>Prints &amp; Etchings</h3>
<p>At around 550 works, prints dominate the art collection, having been the focus of both the initial phase of purchasing by the university in the 1960s and 1970s, and of Professor Irene Manton&#8217;s collecting dues to her interest in the history of print making and in prints as an affordable means of making art accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>The collection is international in scope (ranging from First Nation/Inuit, Africa, India, a wide scope of the history of Japanese and Chinese print making (18<sup>th</sup>c. – 20<sup>th</sup>c.), European Modernism, Abstract Expressionism to local artists within Northern England). Some of our earliest prints come from the Northern Renaissance movement in the 15<sup>th</sup> century (works by Hanns. S. Lautensack (1553) and Albrecht Dürer (1505)). Evidence of a range of print methods in the collection vary from lithographs to screen-prints, woodcuts to giclée printing, dry point etching and even printmaking equipment in the form of a Japanese wood printing block from the 18<sup>th</sup> century.<sup>5</sup> Prints by Pablo Picasso, Joan Mirò, Rembrandt, Dürer, and Hockney are present within the collection.</p>
<h3>Photography</h3>
<p>The majority of photography within the collection is contained within the Chambers Bequest and Gift. These photographs were made partly to document the factory life of the Pilkington&#8217;s site at Clifton Junction, to document inspiration for possible designs and patterns, commemorative purposes and personal photography. Another collection of photography is E. E. Clarke&#8217;s personal documentation of his walks in and around the Lake District and Cumbria. These also include photos of his residence and colleagues, wildlife, topographical features and for the majority, in general, natural landscapes. Both Clarke&#8217;s and Chamber&#8217;s collections can be considered archival and personal to their taste rather than specifically artistic in scope.</p>
<p>The PSG also has a robust collection of art photography, including a collection of photography by Mel Brimfield. It explores both contemporary performance and theatre practises as well as a ‘Vasari-minded&#8217; camp exploration into the lives of artists and B-Movie horror (Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, Jackson Pollock and Vincent Van Gogh). A stark and monochromatic exploration into organic and geological form by Paul Kenny in the form of a photographic print series was the result of an artist&#8217;s residency c.2004/2005.</p>
<h2>Sculpture</h2>
<p>The sculpture collection includes both sculpture in the public realm around the campus (and an associated maquette), and smaller works for interior display.</p>
<h3>Campus Sculpture</h3>
<p>Sculptures around campus were commissioned or acquired for the university to compliment the landscaping and Brutalist styling of the buildings, particularly in the early decades. These include Barbara Hepworth&#8217;s <em>Dual Form (</em>1965, bronze) (BH 396, edition of 7, with other versions situated at the Guildhall, St Ives; Leeds City Art Gallery; Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo, The Netherlands; The Phillips Collection, Washington D.C., USA; and the Portland Art Museum, Portland, Oregon, USA). Annelise Henecka&#8217;s <em>Metamorphosis of Daphne </em>(1973, cast concrete) and John Hoskin&#8217;s <em>Abstract Form</em> (1973, aluminium)<sup>1</sup> were both commissioned for the campus as result of artist residencies during the early 1970s, and both Henecka and Hoskin taught at the university.</p>
<p>From the late 1990s to the 2000s, a committee was established to commission further sculptures for the benefit of the campus. <em>Bull&#8217;s Head</em> and <em>Angel in Boots</em> (c.1995, limestone) were acquired from Shawn Williamson, a Cumbria-based sculptor and alumnus of Lancaster University (in the form of St Martin&#8217;s College) and <em>Sesqui</em> from Charles Hadcock, who went on to be chair of the PSGCT (2017-2023).</p>
<p>While there are a number of memorial and commemorative monuments and plaques around the university, these are not considered to be part of the collection and therefore are not included within the scope of this policy document.</p>
<h3>Gallery Sculpture</h3>
<p>The collection includes smaller sculptural works in a variety of media including metal, stone, plaster, wood and acrylic/plastic. These include Rory McEwen&#8217;s <em>Prismatic Perspex Box</em> (1967, acrylic and Perspex) and Oliver Bevan&#8217;s <em>Light Box</em> which both rely on light and optical illusion/play. Other examples are Jimmy Boyle&#8217;s <em>Adieu to All That</em> (2005, clay, bronze and marble), Hannah Frank&#8217;s <em>Conversation</em> (1977, bronze) and Ben Turnbull&#8217;s <em>EVERY HOME SHOULD HAVE ONE (BUGSY MALONE)</em> (2012, mixed media).</p>
<h2>Applied arts</h2>
<h3>Ceramics</h3>
<p>Chambers Bequest and Gift contains a significant collection of Pilkington&#8217;s and Royal Lancastrian Ware ceramics. These take a variety of forms including moulds, decorative tiles, hat pins, buttons, jars, vases, dishes, bowls, plates, mosaic tiles and animal forms, giving a chronological and stylist spread from the 1880s to the 1950s.</p>
<p>The Chambers Bequest is complemented by a variety of twentieth and twenty-first century ceramics by artists including Halima Cassell, Emmanuel Cooper, Pamela Leung, James Tower and Jason Wason.</p>
<h3>Textiles</h3>
<p>The collection includes a very small number of textile pieces. These include Gay Swift&#8217;s textile collage<em> Night Flowers</em> (1970) and Garth Gratrix&#8217;s beach towel artworks such as <em>Seaside </em>(2021).</p>
<h2>Antiquities</h2>
<p>Lancaster University&#8217;s Collection includes a number of antiquities collected by Irène Manton. The collection includes Roman, Greek, Cypriot and Egyptian vessels in ceramic and glass, and a selection of artefacts which relate to Professor Manton&#8217;s interest in the history of writing, viniculture, ancient faience making, ecological ornamentation and other areas if collecting linked to her wide-ranging academic enquiries.</p>
<p>Examples of items from the collection include a Roman glass beaker, an Egyptian papyrus fragment from a Book of the Dead, an Ethiopian prayer scroll, a Persian seal stamp in bronze, Cypriot wares, a Greek Kylix, and an inscribed brick from Babylonia. Manton included replicas as well as originals in her collection.</p>
<p>The provenance of some parts of the antiquities collection is problematic, reflecting Manton&#8217;s pattern of purchasing from dealers in the 1960s and 1970s who offered certificates of authenticity but little further provenance information and whose sources may have included those illegally removing antiquities from Cyprus or Turkey, for example. It is possible that future research will pave the way for restitution claims, and in the short term the museum will work with decolonisation initiatives within the university to consider how these objects can be used as a learning resource around critical heritage and help expand understandings of repatriation, archaeological context and provenance.</p>
<h2>Digital &amp; Film</h2>
<p>The PSG holds a number of films in its collection that were acquired in the 2010s.</p>
<p>Notable examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Jumpers (what must I do to be saved)</em> (2013) by Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard, a commissioned video installation that looks at a live experiment in manipulation and compliance.</li>
<li>Four performance films by Mel Brimfield: <em>Death and Dumb Part 2</em> (2013), <em>Clement Greenberg – Lee Krasner = Jackson Pollock</em> (2013), <em>Between Genius and Desire – Jackson (after Ed Harris)</em> (2013), <em>An Audience with Willy Little (film excerpt of live performance) </em>(2013).</li>
<li>A solitary film that combines film and painting by Taiwanese artist Wu Chi-Tsung, <em>Landscape in the mist 001</em> (2012).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Installation pieces by the artists Peter Liversidge and Sena Başöz have been acquired recently and reflect a broadening of the range of art practices collected. Liversidge&#8217;s Physical Jukebox (2023) is an immersive installation activated by the audience, while An Invisible Thread (2023) is a site-specific work within the University Library. Başöz&#8217;s <em>Forough</em> (2018) acts as a ‘flying archive&#8217; blending ecology, historiography and sound into one unified experience that resonates with the trauma of Turkey&#8217;s history and the country&#8217;s wildlife.</p>

				     	<p>Poole Museum and Arts Service was created in 1974, under the local authority of the Borough of Poole. The Service assumed responsibility for the collections from Poole&#8217;s first public museum, located in Mount Street. The building for the Mount Street museum, which opened in 1890, had been provided for the people of Poole by John J. Norton, a local timber merchant. Early collections predominately comprised natural history, world cultures, archaeology, social history, decorative art and fine art. It is believed some material had been transferred to the museum from the old Library and that specimens may have been collected by members of the Literary and Scientific Institute. From 1890 to 1974, the museum collections were expanded in a generally undefined manner.</p>
<p>Since 1974, Poole Museum has sought to predominately acquire material of local significance that reflects and represents the social, cultural and economic life of Poole. Collecting has been undertaken in the fields of social history (domestic, maritime, trade and industry), fine art, decorative art, archaeology, photography, documents, ephemera and books. Further acquisitions have included non-local material that provide context to the wider collection. Significant acquisitions in recent years include a nationally important Iron Age log boat, material from the 16th century Studland Bay and 17<sup>th</sup> century Swash Channel shipwrecks and objects from the Poole Pottery Museum sale in 2004.</p>
<p>Following a local authority restructure, Poole Museum and Arts Service ceased to exist in 2019. Poole Museum is now governed by Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council.</p>

<h2>Ceramics &amp; Decorative Art</h2>
<p>A large ceramics collection, predominately the products of Poole Pottery and Carter &amp; Co. A large proportion of the collection, as well as Poole Pottery archival material (on deposit at the Dorset History Centre), was acquired from the sale of the Poole Pottery Museum collection in 2004. Also included are products of other local potteries, such as the Crown Dorset Pottery, as well as other commemorative and non-local wares. Some Oriental ceramics from the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> centuries, possibly associated to local Newfoundland merchant families. A small amount of other decorative arts material.</p>
<h2>Archaeology</h2>
<p>A large collection predominantly consisting of the archaeological archives for excavations in Poole and the surrounding area, a large proportion of which were carried out by the former Poole Museum Service Archaeological Unit during the 1970s-90s. Strengths include a large quantity of material from the Foundry site (a 15<sup>th</sup> century boatyard), locally excavated Medieval and Post-Medieval pottery and Roman material, in particular finds from the Lake Roman fortress (an early fortress from the time of Vespasian and the only one in the country not to have been built on). The collection also includes a small number of chance/individual finds, both local and non-local, some of which originate from the early museum collections. The museum additionally holds a number of archaeological archives deposited by external archaeology contractors.</p>
<h3>Maritime Archaeology</h3>
<p>In addition to land-sourced material, the collection includes significant maritime archaeology. This comprises an Iron Age log boat and the small finds, armaments and timbers from the 16<sup>th</sup> century Studland Bay shipwreck and the 17<sup>th</sup> century Swash Channel shipwreck.</p>
<h2>Documents and Ephemera</h2>
<p>A large collection of documents and ephemera relating to local industry and commerce, governance, transport, military and domestic life. Also includes non-local ephemera, as well as a collection of maps (local and non-local), architectural plans and designs.</p>
<h2>Photography</h2>
<p>A large collection of mostly local subjects in various photographic formats. There is a strong representation of 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> century local scenes and portraits. Includes a small amount of audio-visual material.</p>
<h2>Costume &amp; Textiles</h2>
<p>The costume and textiles collection comprises mainly women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s costume and accessory items from the late 19<sup>th</sup>-mid 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, including a large quantity of late 19<sup>th</sup>&#8211; early 20<sup>th</sup> century christening and baby&#8217;s dresses. Other items include uniforms and needlework items, such as samplers and embroideries.</p>
<h2>Natural History</h2>
<p>A large collection of life science and earth science specimens. Life science material includes taxidermy, skeletal material, botanical specimens, spirit/bottled specimens, marine specimens (including a large collection of shells) and cased invertebrates. Earth science material includes fossils and rock and mineral specimens. Most of the material is non-local, although there is a small number of items of local origin among the taxidermy and geological specimens.</p>
<h2>World Cultures</h2>
<p>Non-British material including objects collected by Poole residents from travels overseas. Collection items principally originate from Africa and Asia, with a small number of objects from the Pacific, America and Europe.</p>
<h2>Numismatics</h2>
<p>A collection of some 1400 coins and tokens, including British and foreign coins from the 18<sup>th</sup>-20<sup>th</sup> centuries, local and non-local trade tokens and commemorative coins and medals.</p>
<h2>Books and Periodicals</h2>
<p>A collection of books and periodicals, mostly of historical, topographical and maritime subject matter, both local and non-local. Includes books from the Mathews Collection (bequeathed by E.F.J. Mathews, a local historian).</p>
<h2>Learning and Handling Collection</h2>
<p>A quantity of non-accessioned material used as a resource for handling and learning purposes, on site and through outreach activities. Most is incorporated in a series of themed loan boxes managed by the museum learning team. Objects in this collection have been sourced from the core museum collections, donations and through purchase.</p>
<h2>Local History Research and Reference Material</h2>
<p>The museum holds a sizeable collection of non-accessioned primary and secondary material that is used as a reference resource for local history research, both by members of the public and staff. This includes books, documents, newspapers, maps, ephemera and oral-history recordings.</p>

				     	<p>Port Sunlight Museum&#8217;s collections chiefly focus on the social history of the village and Lever Brothers factory. A collection began in 1999 with the creation of Port Sunlight Village Trust, based around items in an existing heritage centre. Following the opening of a new museum in 2006, more active collecting began, through encouraging donations and occasional purchases. Collecting has broadly followed special exhibitions or projects, resulting in some themes developing, such as the Great War, village societies, and Edwardian domestic items.</p>

				     	<p>The museum currently has over 2,100 items accessioned into the collection, of which around 80% are photographs, prints and documents, 10% are small social history items such as medals, watches and trophies, 5% are Lever Brothers soaps and packaging and 5% larger objects such as signs, furniture and architectural pieces.</p>
<p>Port Sunlight Museum holds material which is archival in nature, such as personal documents from families who lived in the village, conveyances relating to the purchase of land on which Port Sunlight was built, and records of work undertaken on the properties in the village. This is used to understand and interpret the story of the village, adds to the significance of objects in the collections and is made available to researchers on request. While archival material is not a priority for active collecting, we will continue to acquire such material when offered for donation provided it meets our approach described.</p>

				     	<h2>Ceramics</h2>
<p>The collection is dominated by the pottery, porcelain and other ceramics holdings, which are the largest and most comprehensive in the world within their field of Staffordshire ceramics. The 19th century ceramics collection is particularly strong, especially in figures, tiles, and porcelain tablewares. The 20th century material, industrial and studio, now forms the best collection of 20th century British ceramics in the world, particularly of pottery. The collection of 18th century earthenwares (pottery) and stonewares is also particularly strong. The collection moreover contains examples of ceramics from all around the world, from a vast range of countries and cultures, including Renaissance Italian maiolica, Islamic ceramics, Ancient Greek ceramics, and so on.</p>
<h3>Commemorative Ceramics Collection</h3>
<p>The Potteries Museum &amp; Art Gallery has an extensive collection of commemorative ceramic ware including plates and mugs. The collection starts with 17th century slipware chargers, creamware teapots, and later earthenwares, porcelains, stonewares and bone chinas. We have a broad range of 20th century commemorative ceramics, particularly from all major Royal events.</p>
<h3>Figurines</h3>
<p>The Potteries Museum &amp; Art Gallery&#8217;s figures collection includes figures from the 18th century onwards. Many of the figures commemorate famous people or events in history, although many do not. The collection contains figures depicting Classical mythological and theological subjects from the 18th century, famous and infamous people from the 19th century, early 20th century art pottery figures with naturalistic subjects, and the ever-popular 20th century figures from factories such as Royal Doulton.</p>
<h3>The Keiller Collection of Cow Cream Jugs</h3>
<p>This magnificent collection of 667 cow cream jugs built up over a period of 30 years was generously presented to the City of Stoke-on-Trent Museum &amp; Art Gallery in 1962 by Mrs. Gabrielle M. Keiller of Kingston Hill, Surrey. The bulk of the cow cream jugs were manufactured in the second half of the 18th century and the first quarter of the 19th century when few earthenware potters were using an identifiable backstamp. This makes attribution almost impossible for the vast majority of cows, which were collected for their looks not origin. A condition of the gift stipulated that a minimum of two thirds of the Collection should be on permanent exhibition &#8211; the remainder available for study by appointment. The cow cream jugs are now one of the most popular displays at the Potteries Museum &amp; Art Gallery, and are displayed with The Davies Collection of Frog Mugs.</p>
<h3>Davies Collection of Frog Mugs</h3>
<p>The Potteries Museum &amp; Art Gallery&#8217;s collection of 300 frog mugs was donated by Marjorie M Davies in 1987. The collection includes a wide range of pieces dating from the late 18th century to the late 20th century. Most types of pottery, porcelain and china are represented, with a wide range of decoration styles and techniques. The collection is mostly on display in the Ceramics Gallery, with the Keiller Collection of Cow Creamers.</p>
<h2>Fine Art Collection</h2>
<p>The paintings, drawings and sculpture collection covers mostly British art from the 19th. and 20th. C. There is also a good collection of British, Japanese and European prints from the 16th. C. to the present day. Local artists are well represented in all media. There are links with artists associated with the ceramics industry, and with the development of public art within the City. Designated There is a collection of architectural drawings by Sir Charles Barry and others of the Trentham Hall Estate, which is of National significance. The paintings, drawings and sculpture collection covers mostly British art from the 19th. and 20th. C. There are links with artists associated with the ceramics industry, and with the development of public art within the City. There is also a good collection of British, Japanese and European prints from the 16th. C. to the present day. Local artists are well represented in all media.</p>
<h2>Costume and Textile Collection</h2>
<p>The collection includes material from the 15th.C. to the present day, including flat textiles and a group of dolls. The latter include dolls in national costume and dolls illustrating the history of doll making from c.1800 to the present day. The collection includes material from the 15th.C. to the present day, including flat textiles and a group of dolls.</p>
<h2>Science and Industry Collection</h2>
<p>Machinery, tools and equipment relating to the pottery industry and associated trades have been collected, mainly in connection with the Gladstone Pottery Museum and the Etruria Museum, and primarily for display. Machinery, tools and equipment relating to the pottery industry and associated trades have been collected, mainly in connection with the Gladstone Pottery Museum and the Etruria Museum, and primarily for display.</p>
<h2>Archaeology Collection</h2>
<p>Prehistoric material includes finds from two major sites: Ossoms Cave (late upper palaeolithic) and Wetton Mill Minor (Mesolithic). Roman finds include the earliest evidence of pottery production in Stoke, and Anglo-Saxon sites include an Anglian settlement (Catholme) and a 10th.C. kiln in Stafford. Medieval material includes pottery from a 14th.C. Stoke kiln and from Hulton Abbey. The museum is the principal repository for the whole of the Staffordshire area, and has benefited in recent years from major transfers of material from the Staffordshire County Council, Stafford Borough Council and a private museum at Denstone College. Collections include prehistoric, Roman, Anglo-Saxon and Medieval material.</p>
<h3>Subjects</h3>
<p>Archaeological heritage; Archaeological sites; Archaeology; Viking; Archaeological objects; Roman Empire; Archaeological activities; Archaeological research</p>
<h2>Biology Collection</h2>
<p>The biology collection, now numbering about 120,000 objects, evolved from initial collections made by members of the North Staffordshire Field Club in the late 1800s. It focuses on the flora and fauna of Stoke-on-Trent and the Staffordshire County area. This policy to develop the regional significance of the collections means that the Museum has the most comprehensive collection of Staffordshire natural history material anywhere in the world. There are around 15,000 plant and fungi specimens. These include about 6,000 specimens from Eric Edees, the author of the 1972 &#8216;Flora of Staffordshire&#8217;. The animal specimens number over 100,000 items.</p>
<h3>Subjects</h3>
<p>Fauna; Natural history; Zoology; Fungi; Mineralogy; Geology; Palaeontology; Botany; Biology</p>
<h2>Geology Collection</h2>
<p>Approximately 12,000 rocks, minerals and fossils &#8211; most of which have a particular focus on the Carboniferous and Triassic horizons of the local area. Highlights of the collection include around 900 Carboniferous Coal Measure (mainly fish) fossils. The geology collection, now numbering about 20,000 objects, evolved from initial collections made by members of the North Staffordshire Field Club in the late 1800s. It focuses on the fossils, minerals and rocks of Stoke-on-Trent and the Staffordshire County area. This policy to develop the regional significance of the collections means that the Museum has the most comprehensive collection of Staffordshire natural history material anywhere in the world.</p>

				     	<p>The origin of the Museum was an Exhibition to celebrate the Centenary of the opening of the Ravenglass &amp; Eskdale Railway in 1976, which gathered a number of items of equipment and small objects with a photographic display. It attracted interest and funding to convert a disused station building with wheel chair access for a permanent museum site which opened in 1978. The museum was recognised by the Museums &amp; Galleries Commission and subsequently Arts Council England. A further development was the restoration of the former Furness Railway Signal Box in 2000. A two-stage programme to refurbish and extend the original Museum buildings achieved its first phase in 2015 and continued with a new Train Shed for rolling stock with an Archive Room which was completed and opened to the public in June 2017.</p>

				     	<p>The Ravenglass Railway Museum has a collection of over 7,000 objects &#8211; the largest items being narrow gauge and miniature railways rolling stock and locomotives connected with the Ravenglass &amp; Eskdale Railway in Cumbria dating from 1875 to the present. The Museum also holds library, archive and image collections of material about the Railway company, the associated Preservation Society and a large collection of narrow-gauge railway documents and images in the John Milner Collection. Significant objects are part of a 3ft gauge coach from the original railway and 15in gauge Bassett-Lowke 4-4-2 Synolda, 0-4-0 Katie, Internal Combustion Loco No 1 and Quarryman, with redundant wagons and coaches of historic interest that had a valuable role in the railway’s commercial operations. This is supported by a small collection of railway models representing the wider work of the Bassett-Lowke model company which converted the railway to its present form in 1915 and by a large collection of small objects and ephemera covering all aspects of railway and the economic activities associated with it.</p>

				     	<p>RAMM owes the wealth of its extraordinary collections to its origins in the 1860s. Its predecessor, the Devon &amp; Exeter Albert Memorial, was created through public subscription in the wake of Prince Albert&#8217;s death. Civic leaders had been toying with the idea of a museum for several decades as there were important collections of artefacts and specimens in the city, such as those held by the Devon &amp; Exeter Institution, gathered by people who had lived or worked abroad and retired to Devon.</p>
<p>These early donations helped to establish RAMM&#8217;s collection priorities when it opened in 1868 around four subject areas: Antiquities (Archaeology and Local History), Art, Ethnography (World Cultures) and Natural History. Since 1870 RAMM has been a service of Exeter City Council and increasingly collecting in these four areas has been refined and formalised through a policy periodically ratified by elected members.</p>
<p>Between 2011 and 2013 RAMM undertook a root-and-branch review of its collections by assessing information on provenance, significance and usage. The award-winning review identified collections strengths and weaknesses and informed the themes and priorities for future research, collecting and rationalisation. Full details of RAMM&#8217;s collections review methodology are available in a separate document.</p>
<p>While the core themes established at RAMM&#8217;s foundation remain the cornerstone of collecting, the museum&#8217;s acquisition policies have evolved in the subsequent years. For example the 2020-25 Collections Development Policy includes the selective acquisition of contemporary art and photographs. It also acknowledges the thorny issue of preserving and accessioning born-digital material, even though at the current time the museum sector does not have an agreed solution.</p>

				     	<p>RAMM houses a varied collection well in excess of a million items. The principal subject areas are classified under the headings of Antiquities, Costume and Textiles, Decorative Art, Ethnography, Fine Art, Natural Sciences and Social History.</p>
<p>Alongside (and sometimes within) the principal subject areas, RAMM&#8217;s holdings also incorporate inter-disciplinary material, such as Numismatics, Contemporary Art and Photography.</p>
<h2>Antiquities</h2>
<p>Approximately 58,000 accession records refer to the archaeology of Devon and Exeter, Britain, Egypt, the Mediterranean and Western Asia as well as fragments from local buildings. Many of these records refer to group accessions (one accession number may cover a box of many pot sherds for example) so the actual number of objects within the Antiquities collection is significantly higher – estimated at 1,065,000 (Jan 2020).</p>
<p>RAMM&#8217;s local archaeology and history collections represent the heritage of almost every community in Exeter, East Devon, Mid-Devon, Teignbridge and parts of the South Hams and Dartmoor. The collections cover most aspects of domestic, social, cultural, religious, economic and political life over the past 300,000 years.</p>
<p>For a small city, Exeter has been the subject of a huge amount of archaeological attention. The results of this work are deposited at RAMM. The archaeological holdings reflect the history of Exeter: from Roman military origins; a Roman civilian phase; post-Roman decline; Anglo-Saxon renewal; medieval growth; a Tudor and Stuart period of prosperity from trade and colonialism; to a less prominent but affluent Georgian and Victorian period.</p>
<p>Archaeological projects on the outskirts of Exeter have increased our knowledge of the prehistoric, Roman and medieval occupation of the area. For example, during excavations preceding the building of Cranbrook a late Neolithic/early Bronze Age beaker cremation burial was found with a remarkable archer&#8217;s bracer made of stone from Great Langdale and a series of clay weights (probably for tensioning the threads of a loom) were found in a middle Neolithic pit near Exeter airport.</p>
<p>The collection includes a significant number of prehistoric, Roman, medieval and later coins found by archaeological activity as well as hoards found by metal detectorists (e.g. the Roman hoard from Seaton Down). There are significant antiquarian coin find collections, particularly those of W.T.F. Shortt and the Norton collection. These two are of particular note as they contain eastern Mediterranean coins which may be genuine archaeological finds or more recently lost or planted. Coin finds from controlled excavations are of great importance in site dating and interpretation.</p>
<p>Historically, RAMM has collected archaeological material from the whole of Devon; however, since the 1990s, the Museum has only collected archaeological archives from the local authority areas of Exeter, East Devon, Mid Devon, Teignbridge, plus the eastern half of Dartmoor and the South Hams. RAMM holds the archives of field records, site plans, photographs, etc., relating to sites from both Exeter and Devon. RAMM does not collect digital archives from archaeological projects, these are archived with specialised digital repositories such as the Archaeology Data Service (ADS). RAMM levies a fee for the deposition of archaeological archives.</p>
<p>RAMM works actively with the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) and metal detecting communities to encourage detectorists to record their finds. The Museum has acquired finds through the Treasure Act 1996 as well as non-treasure items directly from landowners and detectorists.</p>
<p>Additionally, the antiquities collection includes important architectural fragments from buildings in Exeter and around Devon dating from around AD 950 to 1800. The best examples have regional and national importance as a record of building styles and methods, many of which have been lost during recent development. As with the archaeology collections, they form an important element in establishing a sense of place. Of particular note is a nationally important collection of late medieval ecclesiastical woodwork fragments from churches of the South West collected by Exeter-based Harry Hems.</p>
<p>RAMM has small holdings of foreign archaeology. The majority of the European, Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Greek, Cypriot, Etruscan and Roman material was collected in the 19th and very early 20th centuries. The core of the collection is formed by the Cobham collection of Cypriot antiquities, the Corkill collection of Mesopotamian cylinder seals and the L.A.D. Montague collection. The latter is a good example of a ‘gentleman&#8217;s&#8217; antiquities collection, mostly purchased from dealers and including a Greek hoplite helmet said to be from the Battle of Marathon. Individual objects of interest include: the mummy of Shep en-Mut, a late 18th-dynasty stone sculpture head, possibly Tutankhamun or Horemheb, and examples of Coptic textiles.</p>
<h2>Contemporary art</h2>
<p>Contemporary art and craft in RAMM&#8217;s collection has been acquired by purchase (with grant support) and donation in recent years and works are found across the collection areas. Sculpture has been a particular focus for collecting including works by Steffen Dam, Polly Morgan, Geoffrey Preston and Michael Shaw. The ethnographic collection includes artwork commissioned to celebrate the museum&#8217;s international links, such as by Rosanna Raymond and Suzuki Mutsumi.</p>
<h2>Costume and Textiles</h2>
<p>RAMM&#8217;s collections management database includes approximately 15,000 verified records relating to the costume and textiles collection. However, many of these refer to a group of items, so it is estimated that the actual number of objects in the collection is nearer 22,000.</p>
<p>The Costume and Textiles collection illustrates the types of clothes worn by local men, women and children from 1750 to the present day, with some much earlier examples of underwear, accessories and textiles. The collection is strongest in middle/upper class female clothing but is better balanced for more recent periods, including every day and occupational clothes worn by people of all classes in Exeter.</p>
<p>The collection of lace, some 2000 items including documentation and equipment, is particularly strong. It covers European and British laces (and allied techniques) from the 16th century to the present day. The Bury Palliser and Treadwin collections &#8211; both important 19th-century collections of English and continental lace samples &#8211; were among the first collections to be given to the museum in the 1860s. They are unique to RAMM.</p>
<p>The strength of the Costume and Textiles collection is the quantity of material with strong local connections, whilst the quality and quantity of items ranks it among the top ten costume collections in Britain. Many objects have been published.</p>
<h2>Decorative Art</h2>
<p>The Decorative Art collection covers a broad field. It comprises approximately 500 items of silver, 1300 ceramics and 400 glass objects, as well as smaller collections of civic regalia, furniture, horology, pewter and other metalwork.</p>
<p>RAMM&#8217;s collection of Devon silver is of international importance and dates from the medieval period to the present day. Most was acquired in the postwar years through the Veitch bequest and through the Reynolds Chard bequest. The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum Purchase Grant in 1995 allowed the acquisition of the Corfield Spoon Collection. The museum also has some important early church silver on loan from churches within the diocese. The collections at the Guildhall are mostly of a later date and with Civic associations. The most recent acquisition was two Elizabethan silver mounted tigerware jugs from Exeter, c.1580-90, purchased in 2012 through the Reynolds Chard bequest and the V&amp;A PG Fund and the Art Fund.</p>
<p>The ceramics collection is made up of English and continental material from the 17th century to the present day. Some is of a high quality and the collections of studio and local Devon potteries are of national importance. A recent acquisition was a piece of studio pottery made by the local ceramicist Bruce Chivers who donated a raku ware vessel in 2017.</p>
<p>The museum has a large and representative collection of glass dating from the early 18th century, based on the Clarke bequest of 1928. There are several pieces of special note such as the Joanna Southcott beakers and Charles II flute glass.</p>
<p>RAMM&#8217;s collection of horology embraces clocks, watches and clock and watch-making tools from the 17th to the 20th centuries. Most of the watch collection was bequeathed by C.R. Venn in 1928 and is one of the most important collections outside London, including several very rare time-pieces. Later acquisitions, including an 18th-century watch by Henry Gard of Exeter, acquired in 2011, have filled some of the gaps in RAMM&#8217;s collection.</p>
<h2>Ethnography</h2>
<p>RAMM&#8217;s ethnographic collection consists of some 12,000 items. In 1998 the whole collection was awarded Designated status in recognition of its significance and national importance. The collection includes items from many parts of the world and reflects acquisitions made during the time of British colonialism in the late 18th century through to the early 20th century.</p>
<p>The collection represents Africa, particularly Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya and South Africa; the Americas, with strengths in Arctic, N.W. Coast and Plains region of the USA, and Amazonia; the Arab world, particularly Oman; Asia – India, Myanmar; and the Pacific, notably Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Australia, Polynesia.</p>
<p>Many of the items were collected by local residents. The majority being brought back as gifts, souvenirs and occasionally as trophies of conflict. They represent connections made between local people and source communities in other parts of the world over the past 250 years.</p>
<p>After the Museum opened in 1868, a number of significant donations followed:</p>
<p>The Devon and Exeter Institution transferred items to RAMM, including rare items from Tahiti collected by Francis Godolphin Bond (HMS Providence) on the 2nd breadfruit voyage under Bligh in 1792. There are also Inuit items acquired by Captain Sabine who served under Captain Sir Edward Parry on the 1819-23 voyage to Lancaster Sound.</p>
<p>The Reverend Henry Townsend was an Exeter-born missionary based in Nigeria who set up a mission in the new Egba city of Abeokuta in 1846. Some of the prestigious items he received went on display in the Great Exhibition of 1851 and were later donated to RAMM.</p>
<p>In 1868 art collector Henry Vaughan donated a collection of items from Captain Cook&#8217;s second and third voyages. These items had been purchased by Vaughan&#8217;s father and uncle at the 1806 Leverian auction.</p>
<p>Crew members acquired artefacts on the voyages of the HMS Discovery (Vancouver 1790-95) and HMS Blossom (Beechey 1825-28) to the Pacific, Arctic and North West coast of America. In 1865 botanist John Gould Veitch participated in a collecting voyage on the HMS Curaçoa. Artefacts from all of these voyages are found in RAMM&#8217;s collections.</p>
<p>F.W.L. Ross, whose journal records a visit to the Marquesas Islands whilst serving on the HMS Tagus in 1813, built his own museum in Topsham. With the help of his naval contacts, he received some rare American and Polynesian items which are now in RAMM&#8217;s collection.</p>
<p>Ivory and rubber trader Richard E Dennett, acquired a collection of artefacts from the Congo in the 1870s which came to the Museum. These iconic items were possibly acquired by him as a member of the Lemba trading guild.</p>
<p>Items relating to James Bandinel of the anti-slave department at the Foreign Office (1824-49) were presented to the Museum by his son Rev. James Bandinel in 1889. The artefacts are evidence that Royal Navy ships had lawfully seized slaving vessels.</p>
<p>Acquisitions to enhance RAMM&#8217;s ethnography collection have continued to the present. Priority has been given to items which improve the quality and range of existing collections. Donations, which include Jevan Berrangé&#8217;s donation of items from the Amazon region of Guyana and Brazil and Leslie Read&#8217;s 1980s Chhau masks from India, have filled gaps in terms of style and quality.</p>
<p>Similarly, Jenny Balfour-Paul&#8217;s donation of barkcloth, the Elizabeth Norris donation of Asian embroidery and the Stephanie Odam donation of clothing from Oaxaca, Mexico, have considerably enhanced existing material. Conall Macfarlane&#8217;s gift (via the Acceptance in Lieu scheme) enabled the Museum to acquire a Maori mere pounamu (greenstone weapon) to replace a badly fragmented example.</p>
<p>Consideration is also given to selective acquisition of items for use in developing understanding between users of the museum and communities represented by the ethnographic collections. The commissioning of new artwork, such as Rosanna Raymond&#8217;s Genealogy in 2007 which reflects the significance of bark cloth to Polynesian identity in the modern world. Sheila Unwin&#8217;s significant donation of East African beadwork illustrates adornment as currency, social indicator and fashion, in contrast to existing examples from the 19th century. RAMM&#8217;s acquisition of Suzuki Mutsumi&#8217;s Golden Field of Rice (2009) through the Art Fund Collect scheme in 2010 reflects ancient technique with modern aesthetics.</p>
<p>Recent policy has enabled RAMM to acquire well-documented items by donation, bequest and exceptionally by purchase, where these items were originally made and used by peoples in the indigenous communities of Africa, the Americas, the Pacific Islands and Asia, and have been collected by people residing or having a significant connection to Devon and Exeter.</p>
<h2>Fine Art</h2>
<p>The collection includes material from the 16th century to the present. It comprises approximately 500 paintings, 3000 drawings and watercolours, 3500 prints and a small collection of sculpture.</p>
<p>The Fine Art collections are strong in 18th and 19th-century local artists &#8211; in particular Francis Towne, John White Abbott and John Gendall, representing Exeter and Devon topographical scenes. Since 2005, significant Devon artists of this period (pre-dating the 20th century), such as Francis Hayman, Benjamin Robert Haydon and Richard Cosway have been acquired via grant aid in order to extend and consolidate this already significant collection. These artists are either native to or have a tradition of working in Devon.</p>
<p>Artists (of excellence and significance) beyond the above remit, including a John Opie portrait of Micaiah Towgood, have been acquired only via donation or bequest.</p>
<p>The representative collection of 20th-century paintings, prints and drawings has been developed, with the addition of works linking to artists already featured in the collections (e.g. Duncan Grant, Walter Sickert) and the groups and schools with which they were associated (e.g. Bloomsbury, Camden Town, Euston Road). Recent acquisitions here included a David Bomberg landscape. Works by war artists have lately been consolidated by the acquisition of Leighton Hall Woollatt&#8217;s Blitz scenes, among others.</p>
<p>The acquisition of local works, for example landscapes and portraits, can be of more importance for their topographical or historical significance than their artistic merit. RAMM has continued to acquire selected additions of work related to the region, such as Exeter and Devon landscapes; work with a connection to the region through ownership or provenance; and work by established professional artists born, trained or resident in the region, including artists-in-residence. Important recent acquisitions to this part of the collection include works by John White Abbot and Leighton Hall Woollatt.</p>
<p>Works in RAMM&#8217;s sculpture collection range from the medieval period onwards. The acquisition of sculpture is limited by size, storage and conservation factors. However important 20th century small-scale works include Zennor by Barbara Hepworth, Carapace by Michael Ayrton and Triple Loop by Bill Pye.</p>
<h2>Natural Sciences</h2>
<p>RAMM&#8217;s Natural Sciences collections are wide in scope covering zoology, botany and geology. They contain British and foreign material of high quality and scientific importance. Approximately 121,000 accession records relate to Natural Sciences objects. Many of these records refer to group accessions (for example, one accession number may cover an entire cabinet of entomology specimens) so the actual number of objects within Natural Sciences is estimated in excess of 500,000.</p>
<p>The molluscs number approximately 70,000 individual specimens with good global and taxonomic coverage. In January 2020 George Montagu&#8217;s collection of shells received Designated status from Arts Council England. It includes 120 lots with type status and attracts international research interest. It is the most intact and taxonomically important collection of British shells of the early 19th century to be found anywhere in the UK. Juliana Linter&#8217;s collection of approximately 14,000 exotic land snail shells is also noteworthy for it includes many rare or extinct species as well as some type material.</p>
<p>Percy Sladen&#8217;s echinoderm collection comprises several thousand microscope slides and fossils from the collection of W.B. and P.H. Carpenter and over 2,500 dry and wet-preserved echinoderms. Some of these echinoderms were collected on the expeditions of HMS Challenger (1872-76) and HMS Lightning (1868). This is one of the best echinoderm collections in the UK outside of national museums.</p>
<p>RAMM has excellent British and exotic butterfly collections numbering in the region of 100,000 specimens, many of which have been consolidated (organised taxonomically rather than by collector). RAMM also has excellent holdings of British beetles and spiders.</p>
<p>Birds are a particular area of strength within the vertebrate collection with more than 12,500 study skins, eggs, bones and mounts. The specimens are of native and exotic species with good global coverage and include those now extinct or exceedingly rare such as the kakapo, huia, moa, ivory-billed woodpecker and passenger pigeon. Some of RAMM&#8217;s most iconic objects are mammals. Of the 1,400 mammal specimens around 60 were collected by big game hunter Charles Victor Alexander Peel including the giraffe as well as a polar bear and an African elephant. Reptiles, fish and amphibians are less well represented.</p>
<p>The botany collection is a good reflection of the activities of collectors from Victorian times up to the mid-20th century. Specimens from early collectors such as D&#8217;Urban and Hiern are particularly data-rich. Both collections include local and national material. Some of Hiern&#8217;s specimens have been published in Flora of Devon (1939) by Keble Martin and Fraser. Also of note are approximately 2,000 seaweed specimens, many collected by female collectors including Amelia Griffiths, Mary Wyatt, Catherine Cutler, Fanny Hindon and Ellen Hutchins.</p>
<p>The geology collections are strong in specimens from Devon and the South West of England, together with intermittent worldwide coverage. The palaeontology collections are particularly extensive, with important material from the local Cretaceous, Pleistocene and Triassic systems including the holotype of <em>Fodonyx</em><em> </em><em>spenceri</em>.</p>
<h2>Numismatics</h2>
<p>The numismatics collection comprises coins, tokens, medals and bank notes issued in Devon. Archaeological coins and coin hoards are held within the Antiquities collection (see 3.2). The most important elements here are the very fine systematic collection of the silver pennies struck at Devon&#8217;s four Saxon and Norman mints (Exeter, Barnstaple, Totnes and Lydford), which includes some great rarities, and the sequence of Exeter&#8217;s Civil War coinage. There are also good collections of Devon tradesmen&#8217;s tokens of the 17th and 18th centuries, local medals, pub checks and badges, and a small collection of local banknotes. The museum also holds a representative selection of typical British coins of Saxon to modern date and a small collection of Classical coins.</p>
<h2>Photography</h2>
<p>An assessment of RAMM&#8217;s photographic holdings undertaken by a V&amp;A Museum curatorial post identified photographic material in all of RAMM&#8217;s principle collection areas, as well as in the archive. It includes early daguerreotype and ambrotype material from the 1850s to present day prints. It is estimated that there are 600 photographic prints (including unique photographs, original and reproductive prints); 250 negatives and transparencies; 4,700 lantern slides; a small collection of photographic albums and books containing photographs; and a collection related to photographic technology, including photographic equipment and raw materials.</p>
<p>The collection is strong in late 19th and early 20th century material by local, professional photographers with a particular focus on studio portraiture (cartes de visite, cabinet cards, loose and in photographic albums), such as by Owen Angel, James Frederick Long and Heath &amp; Bradnee Ltd.</p>
<p>Highlights of the collection include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four photographic portraits of the Royal family (reproductive prints) by Baron (Stirling Henry Nahum), Alice Hughes, and W. &amp; D. Downey.</li>
<li>A tri-colour carbro print, A Domestic Affair, c. 1925, an outstanding example of early colour photography by Exeter-based photographer Frederick Gordon Tutton (1888-1930).</li>
<li>Book with albumen prints of fungi (c. 1870s-80s), some hand-coloured, by early female photographer Miss M.M. Clarke</li>
<li>Book Hortus Veitchii, 1906 with approx. 50 photogravure illustrations possibly by E.J. Wallis.</li>
<li>Group of 44 photographs of tree specimens collected by JR Jackson (including albumen prints by Samuel Bourne, Bourne &amp; Shepherd, Charles Thomas Scowen, Nicholas &amp; Curth and GR Lambert and Co.)</li>
<li>A unique photographic album (platinum prints) of Reminiscences of Mysore by Barton &amp; Son, Bangalore from c. 1906.</li>
<li>Three crystoleum photographs by Exeter-based photographer Owen Angel, c. 1870s-80s.</li>
<li>Daguerreotype of an unknown girl by Charles Henry Williamson (1826-1874), c. mid-1850s.</li>
<li>Photographic portraits (originals and reproductive prints in the form of cartes de visite, cabinet cards, gelatin silver prints, as part of photographic albums) by local and national photographers and photographic studios, such as Bertram Park, Houston Rogers, Joseph Parkin Mayall, Maull and Fox, J Russell &amp; Sons.</li>
<li>Two boxes of microphotographs, some made by the pioneer of microphotography John Benjamin Dancer</li>
</ul>
<p>Recent acquisitions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photomontages by Joanna Brown (2014-15).</li>
<li>A photobook, Seeing believing (2017), by Garry Fabian Miller including a small limited edition print The White Cloud, looking towards Ravens Tor, Winter 2014.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Social History</h2>
<p>The Social history collection at RAMM is currently estimated at 9,955 records and 16,945 objects. Social history has recently been identified as a discreet group within RAMM&#8217;s collections and we are currently assessing our holdings for significance.</p>
<p>These objects reflect the history of Exeter and its region from the 17th century onwards. They include artefacts relating to the city&#8217;s institutions (the defences, religious institutions, the Guildhall, public health and the water supply for example), its foreign and regional trade (with highly important material from the operation of the custom port of Exeter), its industries, domestic life and topography (the last including a series of city models ranging in date from c.1820 to the 1970s). There has been little organised collecting in the past, and this is an area the museum is looking to develop in the future.</p>
<p>RAMM holds a small collection of musical instruments including important keyboard instruments as well as some woodwind and string instruments dating from the late 18th century. The 17th-century virginals by Charles Rewalyn of Exeter and the Italian harpsichord 1782 are outstanding pieces.</p>
<p>The small collection of armour and swords is based on local 17th and 18thcentury material. A medium sized collection of firearms has as its core the high quality products of the local firm of W.J. Harvey and other innovative 19th-century firearms collected by W.J. Harvey.</p>
<p>The small technology collection numbering some 296 objects was mainly collected between the 1970s and 1980s, with a few existing older acquisitions being included. A number of objects in this collection were identified as potential candidates for disposal following a rationalisation exercise.</p>
<p>RAMM has a significant collection of objects relating to fire insurance and firefighting, with some of the earliest examples dating from the 18th century. These objects include fire buckets, fire insurance marks, uniform and equipment, and a fire engine used by Exeter Cathedral.</p>

				     	<p>An overview of current collections</p>
<p>The collection contains approximately 100,000 coins – some three-quarters of which reflect the Royal Mint’s extensive overseas work, particularly for Commonwealth countries, including an abundance of proofs, patterns and trial pieces. So far as coins are concerned, the Museum’s primary interest is in the milled, or machine-struck, pieces of the last 350 years but the collection contains coins dating back to the Medieval and Anglo-Saxon periods and also coins from the Ancient World.</p>
<p>The Library contains around 11500 volumes as well as a wealth of archival material and photographs.</p>
<p>In addition, the collection includes something in the order of 12,000 medals and seals along with thousands of drawings, plaster models and electrotypes, and an outstanding collection of trial plates dating back to the 15th century. Above all it incorporates roughly 34,000 master tools and dies from the 17th century onwards, a collection whose importance is unrivalled in the United Kingdom.<br />

<p>The acquisition of objects direct from the Royal Mint factory allows the Museum to acquire a full and accurate account of the work of the Royal Mint and includes a large number of trial coins and medals which do not exist anywhere else. This acquisition direct from the factory allows the Museum to remain true to its original 200 year-old purpose of maintaining a record of Royal Mint production.</p>

				     	<p>History of the collections</p>
<p>The Royal Mint Museum (RMM) has one of the finest numismatic collections in the world. It was established in 1816 by the Master of the Mint, William Wellesley Pole, to provide a permanent record of the work of the Royal Mint. The Museum also has a substantial numismatic library. The coin collection and library was considerably enhanced in 1818 by a generous donation by Sir Joseph Banks on behalf of his sister Sarah Sophia and included a number of rare and important coins and a collection of 16th and 17th century books and pamphlets on British and European coins and medals.</p>

				     	<h2>Social History Collection</h2>
<p>Many domestic activities are represented including cooking, cleaning and pastimes. A collection of dolls, toys and games especially the Trollope Doll&#8217;s House. A large selection of greetings cards records Valentines, Birthdays, Christmas, Easter, births and deaths of times gone by. Postcards reveal images of the town, or greetings sent to Harrogate from further afield. A selection of photographs illustrates buildings, street scenes, people and other aspects of the District, some of which are still with us, and some of which have disappeared. A selection of bicycles celebrates the founding of the Cyclists Touring Club in Harrogate, and many of these are on show in the Royal Pump Room Museum. The tandem tricycle is always popular with visitors, as is the Penny Farthing, dating from 1874. Local shops and trades are represented, such as saddlery linen manufacture, and the chemists so prevalent in the spa. Harrogate&#8217;s Park Drag, a Victorian four-in-hand coach built by the local firm of Mackay and Fowler, would have been an elegant sight on the roads in the area. Harrogate&#8217;s history as a spa town is reflected in much of the material in the museum collection, and we continue to acquire spa related items wherever possible. A Peat Bath from the Royal Baths is on show in the Royal Pump Room Museum. Made of Burma teak, the peat bath would hold 50 gallons of mineral peat, impregnated with iron and salts. A combination needle shower is on display alongside the peat bath. A description from 1910 describes the treatment: There are eight baths here altogether, four entered from the ladies corridor and four approached from the gentlemen&#8217;s corridor. A great saving of space has been effected by installing one needle bath between two bathrooms. These needle baths are not only refreshing in themselves, but achieve their purpose without in the least degree calling upon the patient to exert herself or himself. A Vichy Massage Bath, also on display in the Royal Pump Room Museum, is a wooden table upon which the bather reclined and was massaged, while streams of water poured down from an overhead shower. Other treatment related items in the collection consist of treatment beds, a stretcher and some fixtures and fittings from the Royal Baths.</p>

<h3>Rugby Collection</h3>
<p>The Rugby Collection of 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> century British art is made up of a variety of paintings, prints, drawings, photography and film works that have been purchased and collected by Rugby Borough Council since 1946. The founding principle of the collection intended that: &#8220;The collection will grow each year…the net will be cast wide, policy being limited only by funds available. Rugby will never be able to acquire works of the masters by purchase, but the committee will try to build up a lively and interesting collection of works of artists of promise and renown&#8221;. The collection was developed with the support and input of art advisors, industry experts who made recommendations for purchases and helped with finding funding. Eric Newton, art historian and critic for the Manchester Guardian and the Sunday Times was the first to advise Rugby from 1945 – 1964. Joanna Drew, who held several key positions in the Arts Council of Great Britain, succeeded Eric Newton in 1965 and supported the collection until 1974. The curator Monika Kinley joined Rugby in 1974 and stayed as art advisor until 1982. Throughout the 1980s and 90s active collecting slowed down with the reduction of purchasing budgets. During this period the collection moved temporarily to the University of Warwick where it was cared for and exhibited by the Mead Gallery. From 1988 – 1995 Contemporary Art Society (CAS) acted as art advisors for the collection. The opening of Rugby Art Gallery and Museum in 2000 saw a new acquisition budget established and collecting has continued ever since. Experienced visual art staff at the art gallery now act as art advisors for purchases. The collection offers a unique view of this period of British art through the eyes of the series of experienced art advisors who supported the acquisition process on a regular basis since 1946. Throughout the life of the collection it has benefitted from regular gifts from the Contemporary Art Society through its membership scheme. Many of the significant works in the collection are CAS gifts including works by Bridget Riley, Ceri Richards, Louis Le Brocquy, Barbara Hepworth and Gillian Wearing.</p>
<h3>Local Collection</h3>
<p>The local art collection is a small collection of works of art produced by local artists, which was acquired by the Borough Council from 1979 to 2003.</p>
<h3>Topographical Collection</h3>
<p>This collection, which dates largely from the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century onwards, includes mainly drawings, paintings and prints, which depict local scenes and people. Most were created by local artists including Edwin Brown and Gertrude Hayes.</p>
<h2>Archaeology</h2>
<p>The archaeology collection is dominated by the Tripontium collection, which was excavated by members of Rugby Archaeological Society over a forty-year period from the Roman site located 5 miles from Rugby along the original Watling Street. This collection is divided into two specific collections. The first part is a collection of significant finds, which is on loan to Rugby Art Gallery and Museum for the purpose of display and was a key part of the museum&#8217;s development when first opened in 2000. The second part is the bulk finds which were donated to the permanent collection and is largely in storage. Prior to moving to Rugby Art Gallery and Museum in 2000 the collection was housed at Warwickshire County Museum.</p>
<p>In 2008 Rugby Art Gallery and Museum became an established archaeological depository for excavated material.</p>
<h2>Social History</h2>
<p>The collection&#8217;s origins date from the late nineteenth century when the old Rugby Library was given to the town in 1890 by Richard H Wood and a museum collection was set up alongside the library collection. A small part of the collection dates from this time.</p>
<p>The social history collection aims to document the social and economic history of the borough of Rugby. It has been formally collected since 1999 and comprises of material evidence and associated information relating to the history of the borough of Rugby and of the people who have lived and worked here in the past and present.</p>

				     	<h2>Rugby Collection</h2>
<p>The collection is now made up of 224 works, all of which were created by nationally known artists. It is an eclectic mixture of styles and mediums including painting, print, photography and film. The Rugby collection contains important works by many significant artists of the 20<sup>th</sup> century such as Lowry, Hepworth, Sutherland, Spencer etc and many important contemporary works by artists such as Lubaina Himid, Claudette Johnson and Gillian Wearing.</p>
<h2>Local Collection</h2>
<p>The Local collection is of mixed media, which includes watercolours, oils, pastels, prints, acrylics and ceramics. Active collecting was ceased in December 2003 in order to redirect funds to support local artists in an alternative way through the annual Rugby Open exhibition.</p>
<h2>Topographical Collection</h2>
<p>Many works in the Topographical collection were acquired from the original Rugby Library, which had collected them as part of their ‘museum&#8217; collection.</p>
<h2>Archaeology</h2>
<p>The Tripontium collection includes approx. 37,0000 Roman ceramics, metalwork, bone work, animal bones, human remains, and a very small amount of leather and textile. Key pieces from the collection include a peacock belt buckle, a lead ingot and locally made Roman tiles inscribed with the Latin alphabet and the Corieltauvi tribe dating from the 3<sup>rd</sup> century. The Tripontium archaeological archive is not held by Rugby Art Gallery and Museum but remains with Rugby Archaeological Society.</p>
<p>The museum continues to be an archaeological depository for excavated material currently totalling 60 archives.</p>
<h2>Social History</h2>
<p>The majority of the collection dates from the 20<sup>th</sup> century although there is a small Victorian collection dating from the time of the founding of the library. The collection consists of approximately 50,000 objects, which fall within the four SHIC categories of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Community life – includes education, health, entertainment, sport, community organisations.</li>
<li>Personal Life &#8211; includes clothing, shoes and costume accessories, personal correspondence, keepsakes and photographs.</li>
<li>Domestic and Family Life – includes items related to the home and living environment such as kitchen and laundry, toys and games.</li>
<li>Working Life – including objects used for or created in a working environment and the local industries such as the railway and electrical engineering industries including Willans &amp; Robinson, English Electric, British Thomson-Houston (BTH), AEI and GEC. Includes tools, patents, certificates, products, receipts, advertising and oral histories.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are key photographic collections including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Redding&#8217;s photographic studio collection of glass plates and cellulose acetate negatives dating from 1958-1972 and featuring family, community and working life in the town and surrounding area.</li>
<li>Projector slides from BTH lighting department (Mazda Lamps) dating from 1940s.</li>
<li>BTH publicity department glass plate negatives.</li>

				     	<p>Saltaire Collection tells the story of Saltaire, principally from its origins in the 1850s to the present. The collection developed in an ad hoc way through the interests of key staff members in Shipley College, some residents, former workers in Salts Mill and local historians/researchers.</p>
<p>Textile production at Salts Mill ceased in 1986 and some archive material was deposited by Mill managers. Much of the effort to organise and conserve the collection from the late 1980s was undertaken by Shipley College Learning Resource Centre staff and volunteers, aided by Saltaire History Club members who researched and deposited much interpretive work on documents, plans, maps and images.</p>
<p>Some residents, ex residents and former textile workers deposited personal memory files and oral histories and as efforts were made by organisations such as the Saltaire Village Society to achieve World Heritage Status, more people came forward with valuable donations.</p>
<p>Researchers, undergraduate, post graduate students and local historians continue to add knowledge and value to the Saltaire Collection.</p>
<p>The collection has recently had large acquisitions from several donor or lenders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nick Salt &#8211; Loan &#8211; material relating to the Salts from Milner Field.</li>
<li>Roberts Family -the records of James Roberts who owned the Mill and Village after the Salts sold the business and the Saltaire Estate. This collection was loaned to the Archive for copying, leaving the only publicly available copies (Quasi Originals) with the Archive and a valuable asset to researchers.</li>
<li>Penny Howden and Barnaby Wilmot -the estate of Mary Isabel Salt now known as the Isabel Salt Collection.</li>

				     	<p>The collection comprises of original and quasi original (see below) documents, images, oral history and objects. It is unique as it relates to a World Heritage Site, interpreting the important heritage of the site. Housed in the Exhibition Building an Historic building that was built in memory of Sir Titus Salt by his son Titus Salt junior. The collection focuses on the founder of Saltaire, the successive owners of the Estate, the Estate and People in the village. The collection includes the wider environs of Shipley putting the village of Saltaire into context. Shipley Urban District Council took over the amenities of Saltaire, such as the schools and hospital, but the Salt family continued to be involved with members of the family sitting on boards. All the family homes were outside the Township of Shipley such as Milner Field which is situated in the township of Bingley and the collection reflects this as these items are still relevant to the Story of Saltaire. The Story of Saltaire is a lens on the Textile Industry in Bradford. As Saltaire Collection currently holds and intends to hold Public Records on behalf of the National Archives it will comply with all Place of Deposit legislation as defined in the Public Records Act 1958 as well as the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The focus on collecting is to become the definitive depository for interpreting, researching and education provision for the Village of Saltaire. We recognise that other collection holds significant items for this story, so where possible we will either hold copies or have information on the item to enable anyone to access those items. Saltaire Collection comprises approximately 6000 individual items which are divided into the following types of material:</p>
<h2>Original Documents</h2>
<p>Significance: Historically significant This collection contains original material relating to all aspects of the history of Saltaire, from family archive, from individuals of the Salt family to individual residents in the village. The documents include notebooks, pamphlets, newspaper cuttings, letters, financial documents such as receipts and legal documents such as Wills. Highlights of this collection are;</p>
<ul>
<li>Health provision in Saltaire including the Bath and Wash House plans</li>
<li>Education Provision in Saltaire &#8211; incorporation document Including Saltaire Schools and Shipley college</li>
<li>Isabel Salt Archive &#8211; recent donation from Penny Howden and Barnaby Wilmot</li>
<li>Denys Salts Archive &#8211; Personal Archive but relates to all his family</li>
<li>Clara Baraclough &#8211; personal memories</li>
<li>Percy Price &#8211; Life in Saltaire a personal memory file</li>
<li>George Morell &#8211; especially his retirement presentation book after 45 years working in Education that started in the Dining Hall School</li>
<li>Clive Woods collection covering many aspects of life in Saltaire Village</li>
</ul>
<h2>Maps and Plans</h2>
<p>Significance: Historically significant This is a comprehensive collection, of maps and plans from before the Saltaire Mill and village were built through its development and includes information on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Land Acquisition and use</li>
<li>Transfer documents</li>
<li>Changes to ownership and management of the Mill and the Village, 1918- 1986</li>
</ul>
<p>(10% of enquiries over the last 2 years are about Land Acquisition and use and lan Watson&#8217;s work on this is invaluable)</p>
<h2>Quasi Original Documents</h2>
<p>Significance: Historically significant Quasi original document are documents which are only held in private collections, but an authentic copy has been deposited with the Archive for the public to access. The most significant of these deposits is the Roberts family Archive. It is a Digitised collection of the family records which relates to the Saltaire Estate. The collection is owned by the family and Saltaire Collection has the only copies available to the public. James Roberts purchased Milner Field from Catherine Salt, and he was the sole owner of the Estate (including the Mill) for 20 years and he commissioned the statue of Sir Titus Salt in Roberts Park. Roberts carried on the ethos of the Salts including the philanthropic work and worked to sustain all the charities set up by the Salts.</p>
<h2>Born Digital Collection</h2>
<p>Significance: Historically significant Born digital are items which have been given to the collection in a digital format and have never been published in hard copies such as books. The most significant items in this collection are the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saltaire Congregational Church Records</li>
<li>Collin Coate&#8217;s Timelines &#8211; Social History of Salts Mill, Saltaire public buildings, owners and managers of Salts Mill and the Village.</li>
</ul>
<p>The aim is to enable digitisation of much more of the collection and Appended at 2 is the forward digitisation policy for the collection.</p>
<h2>Books</h2>
<p>Significance: Research collection &#8211; not unique, but invaluable to researchers Significance: Historic Books &#8211; Donations relating to individuals, which is significant as they help tell the story of the individuals such as Titus, Catherine and Isabel Salt.</p>
<ul>
<li>This collection includes research books such as the recent donation from the Wellcome Trust &#8220;Living with Buildings and walking with Ghosts, on Heath and Architecture, by lan Singlair.</li>
<li>Original books, on politics or school books that belonged to members of the Salt family including Titus Salt.</li>
<li>Architectural Studies in Yorkshire by George Bertram Bulmer printed in limited edition for Queen Victoria Jubilee. It was originally owned by Shipley School of Art.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Images</h2>
<p>Significance: Historically significant The images are a wide group of material, from family portraits, prints, postcards and photographs of all aspects of life in the village and the Mill. Significant items include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photographs &#8211; Berry Family &#8211; telling the story of retail in Saltaire</li>
<li>Photographs of the village, residents and workers</li>
<li>The Mill &#8211; Many originals donated by Albert Bowtell</li>
<li>Shipley college &#8211; has always been housed in the Original School building, the Exhibition building and Victoria Hall. The photographs are from the origin as a Technical College and the Royal Exhibition in 1887.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Object Collection</h2>
<p>Significance: Historically significant This collection includes items from Saltaire and the Salt family. Significant items include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Salt Family china which marks occasions such as the opening of the Mill and the Royal visits 1882 and 1887.</li>
<li>Silver Salver &#8211; which was given to Mr Wilson as a retirement gift.</li>
<li>Walking Cane &#8211; presented by Mr Joseph Paley, Bandmaster (24th May 1879) to Mr Joseph Scott, military outfitter who made the uniforms for the Saltaire Mill band.</li>
<li>Dayton Tea pot -links different generations of the Hanson family. William Hanson was Sir Titus Salt&#8217;s chief engineer and his great grandson, Donald Hanson, was chair and chief executive of Illingworth, Morris (who owned Salts Mill) in the 1980&#8217;s</li>
<li>Salts Mill Long Service Certificates</li>
<li>Clive Woods collection of tourism items</li>
</ul>
<p>The collection currently only includes small items and does not intend to collect large items such as looms.</p>
<h2>Costume and Textiles</h2>
<p>Significance: Historically significant Textiles are very important to the history of Salts Mill and Saltaire and in fact Bradford as a whole. This part of the collection is very small and currently tells us more about the Salt family than the work of the Mill. The material in this collection includes;</p>
<ul>
<li>Isabel Salt &#8211; Children&#8217;s clothes, once worn by Isabel and her brother Lawrence</li>
<li>Salt family &#8211; towels and textiles</li>
</ul>

<p>Significance: Historically significant This is a unique collection of personal memories of workers in the Mill or Residents of the Village. Appended at 3 is the approved Oral history Policy and Procedure.</p>
<h2>Personal Research</h2>
<p>Significance: Important for future research, interpretation and education provision of Saltaire. Material Deposited in the Archive written by individual researchers for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>land acquisitions, based on material in the West Yorkshire Archive, researched by lan Watson.</li>
<li>Stone that built Saltaire &#8211; Research by Les Brook</li>
<li>History Club journals, which includes research to various aspects of Saltaire&#8217;s History.</li>
<li>Colin Coates- Time lines, Genealogy</li>
</ul>
<h2>Loans</h2>
<p>Significance: Historically significant Although the collection would prefer to not have loans, where the loan is significant to the history of Saltaire and the donor is willing to allow access to the collection as though it was a normal part of the collection, these loans have been accepted. Short term loans have been taken to facilitate digitisation. The most significant collection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nicholas Salt, whose collection includes material from Milner Field and Catherine Salt nee Crossley.</li>
<li>We will undertake a project of work to digitise this collection to ensure access in the future.</li>

				     	<p>Although developed as distinct museum holdings on different sites, the Science Museum Group Collection is now increasingly understood, developed, managed and cared for as a unified whole. Without losing sight of the unique origins and history of the collection, we aim for it to be consistently searchable, accessible and interpretable online and across all our sites. It reflects the development of our holdings across six sites:</p>
<h2>Science Museum</h2>
<p>The origins of the Science Museum collection lie in the Science collections of the South Kensington Museum, founded in 1857, which later developed into the Victoria and Albert and Science Museums, formally separated in 1909. The Patent Office Museum and the Special Loan Collection of Scientific Instruments, both housed on the South Kensington site, were the foundations of the Engineering and Science collections respectively. The Science Museum became a major repository for the history of medicine with the long-term loan of the Sir Henry Wellcome&#8217;s Museum Collection in 1976. The collection is now divided by three thematic areas: Science, Technologies and Engineering, and Medicine.</p>
<p>The Science Museum&#8217;s world-class library and archive collection charts the world-wide development and history of science, engineering and medicine from the fifteenth to the twentyfirst century. Original printed works include books, journals, patents, trade literature, directories and maps in English and other European languages. The archives hold original records of some of the most famous and influential individuals and companies in the fields of science, medicine, engineering and industry.</p>
<h2>National Railway Museum</h2>
<p>The NRM&#8217;s collection is Britain&#8217;s largest single body of historic railway items. It has its origins in the historic objects variously preserved by the Commissioners of Patents and individual railway companies in the mid to late 19th century. Following rail nationalisation in 1948, the British Transport Commission established a preservation policy bringing the collection together under a single owner. Two decades later, the 1968 Transport Act led to the creation of a National Railway Museum, which opened in York in 1975, with a sister museum, Locomotion, opening at Shildon in County Durham in 2004. The collection has subsequently been significantly developed to cover all areas of railway history and is housed and displayed both at NRM and Locomotion.</p>
<h2>Locomotion</h2>
<p>Locomotion is a sister museum of the National Railway Museum opened at Shildon in County Durham in 2004. Shildon is vitally important to the story of Britain&#8217;s railways, as the place where the world&#8217;s first steam-powered public railway sprang to life creating a thriving railway town. Parts of the NRM collection are housed and displayed at Locomotion.</p>
<h2>National Science and Media Museum</h2>
<p>The National Science and Media Museum in Bradford (previously the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television/National Media Museum) was opened in 1983. The Museum&#8217;s collection was established from the Science Museum&#8217;s existing photography, film and television collection (such as the W.H.F. Talbot, John Logie Baird and Louis Le Prince collections) and has grown through acquisition of whole archives or bodies of material (such as the Kodak Museum Collection or the Impressions Gallery Archive), as well as by smaller-scale commissioning, purchase and donation. In 2015 the Museum adopted a new definition of its primary areas of interest: the science, technology and culture of images and sound.</p>
<h2>Science and Industry Museum</h2>
<p>The collection was formed from 1965, when the Department of the History of Science and Technology at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) began to acquire material. The museum opened in 1969 and was originally called the North Western Museum of Science and Industry. In 1983, the Museum moved to its current premises at the historic Liverpool Road Station, with Greater Manchester Council as its sole funder. In 1985 it added the collection of the adjacent Air and Space Museum, founded by Manchester City Council. In 2012 it joined the Science Museum Group and, as the Science and Industry Museum, documents 250 years of discoveries and innovations that began in Manchester and went on to influence the world. It tells the story of Manchester as the first industrial city, the ongoing interplay between science, industry and society in the North-West region, and its global networks. The collection is divided into three principal areas: science and technology, engineering, and industrial heritage.</p>
<h2>National Collections Centre</h2>
<p>From 2023 the NCC will be our largest storage facility for the Science Museum Group Collection. This large former airfield at Wroughton, near Swindon, was acquired in 1979 both for storage and to allow the development of collection of larger full-size objects such as aeroplanes and commercial road vehicles. The NCC focuses on efficiency, sustainability and the long-term care of objects, optimising our ability to share their stories across the Science Museum Group and with the next generation. As well as objects, the NCC is the storage facility for the Science Museum Library and Archive holdings. As above, these include rare books, 19/20th century collections and trade literature.</p>

				     	<p>Our collections permit us to exhibit wonderful examples of historic fishing boats and gear. They help us to illustrate the geography and social structures of our fishing communities. They allow us to honour their ways of life, skills, customs, dress, creativity, and resilience, and to improve understanding of the various external environmental, technological, political, and commercial circumstances, which had and still continue to have such an impact upon them.</p>
<p>The founding collection of the Scottish Fisheries Museum was acquired in 1967 by gift from Provost Carstairs of Anstruther who had amassed a large private collection of objects and artworks relating to the fishing industry throughout his career as a fishing agent, factory owner and public figure.</p>
<p>This collection was supplemented in the museum’s early years by numerous gifts, loans and transfers from other museums, notably from National Museums Scotland and the Science Museum, and from private individuals.</p>
<p>The collections have developed in both a reactive and proactive manner, with the aim, from the start, to establish a national overview of the Scottish commercial sea-fishing industry in all its aspects. The inclusion of working objects enables the Museum to support Intangible Cultural Heritage and living heritage. Owing to the location of the museum, and the historical bias of commercialised fishing activity on the east coast, the west coast is less well represented.</p>
<p>The entire collection cared for by the Scottish Fisheries Museum is a Recognised Collection of National Significance, awarded by Museums Galleries Scotland on behalf of the Scottish Government.</p>

				     	<p>The collection of SFM consists of over 65,000 items covering the Scottish Fishing Industry from around Scotland with a particular focus on the East coast, and comprises objects, archives, and photographs. The core of the collection comprises 19th and 20th century objects although the period of time to which the collection relates is c.500AD (Loch Doon Log Boat) &#8211; to the present day. The Collecting Area for the SFM will be defined by the geographical boundaries of Scotland</p>

<h2>Model Boats</h2>
<p>The collection comprises 170 models of fishing vessels, builder&#8217;s half models, ships in bottles, sailing models and engines. The collection is broadly representative and includes modern fishing vessels. From necessity a number of models are on loan (approx. 10%). There is some material associated with the whaling industry and also the merchant sailing ships associated with Anstruther.</p>
<h2>Associated Industries</h2>
<p>The various industries associated with and supporting the fishing industry are well represented. SFM is particularly strong in wooden boat-building equipment, including the Smith &amp; Hutton Collection and SFM has acquired a large number of items from the Cardy Net Factory, Lower Largo, Fife.</p>
<h2>Fishing Vessel Equipment</h2>
<p>The SFM has a good representative collection of fishing vessel equipment and is particularly strong in electronic equipment, lights, flares and navigational aids. Other areas in the collection include: engines and associated equipment, hauling gear, fish finding, navigation and communication equipment, galley equipment, safety equipment and discharging gear.</p>
<h2>Fishing Equipment</h2>
<p>The Museum has a representative collection of fishing gear and is particularly strong in nets and lines. The Museum houses part of the important Buckland Collection of salmon and eel spears. The main areas of gathering, trapping and hunting methods are well represented.</p>
<h2>Costume</h2>
<p>SFM has good collection of fisher folk costume, both working clothes and Sunday Best. The collection comprises over 1,000 items and is strong on items from the East Neuk of Fife. There are also Newhaven Fishwives Choir costumes based upon the Newhaven &#8220;Gala&#8221; dress, and an internationally significant collection of knitted ganseys.</p>
<h2>Social and Domestic Life</h2>
<p>The nature of the development of the Museum has led to a strong collection of domestic items from the fisher homes of the East Coast, including furniture, cooking utensils and decorative items. Social history and fishing personalities are well covered in the Photographic and Document Archive.</p>
<h2>Whaling</h2>
<p>The whaling and sealing collection is small but includes a number of harpoons, tools and samples from Christian Salvesen of Leith and whalebone and scrimshaw items.</p>
<h2>Marine Sciences</h2>
<p>There is an extensive collection of fish species plaster casts from the Buckland Collection, and archival holdings relating to scientific study.</p>
<h2>East Neuk Maritime History</h2>
<p>The Museum recognises a subsidiary role as the East Neuk Maritime Museum. In practice this means housing a very good collection of models, paintings and objects associated with the clipper ship activity of the area, such as Captains Keay and Rodger of Ariel and Taeping. This collection is restricted to items which can demonstrate a good connection with the contextual maritime history of the area. It includes the cannonball allegedly fired by John Paul Jones at the May Island.</p>
<h2>Learning Collection</h2>
<p>The Museum holds a small Learning Collection managed by the Learning and Engagement Officer. Acquisitions to the Learning Collection follow the due diligence standards set out in the Collections Development Policy. However, as objects are acquired for the purposes of handling and public display in the knowledge that they will deteriorate and be disposed of, they are not formally Accessioned.</p>

				     	<p><strong>Fine Art</strong></p>
<p>The art historian, John Thompson has stated that the story of western art from the Renaissance to the present day can be told using Southampton’s collection. The earliest work in the collection, Allegretto de Nuzio’s <em>Coronation of the Virgin,</em> is from the mid-fourteenth century.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The smaller old-master element of the collection has good clusters of work of the Renaissance, Baroque (notably Dutch 17th century), British 18th century and French and British 19th century (including Impressionism and Pre-Raphaelitism).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The core of the collection is built around British 20th century and contemporary art. Within that are four strong clusters: the Camden Town Group and related British Post-Impressionism (one of the best world-wide outside the Tate), Surrealists, St Ives School and Contemporary post 1976 (over 30 Turner Prize winners and nominees). The collection includes oil paintings, works on paper, sculpture, studio ceramics, wall-drawings and film/video work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Archaeology</strong></p>
<p>The archaeology collection contains material recovered from the city and its environs from the 19<sup>th</sup> century onwards. This includes a range of material collected prior to the beginnings of formal excavation programmes in the 1950s. This material, much collected by enthusiastic local people, such as the Rev Edmund Kell, and William Dale, includes large numbers of prehistoric stone and flint objects, Roman coins, pottery and metal objects, an eclectic range of Saxon and medieval objects, all from the city, as well as material from other parts of southern England and from abroad.  Much of this material is of poor provenance but provides important evidence of early archaeological recording and is a rich source of stories from all periods of Southampton’s past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The major element of the archaeology collection consists of the archives from over 1600 formal archaeological investigations (excavations, watching briefs, building and photographic surveys) carried out within the city since the 1950s. These archives include plans, photographs, paper and digital records as well as environmental samples and the artefacts themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These collections are extensive, and provide unique, in-depth evidence of the domestic, industrial and trading activities of the Saxon and medieval towns. The Saxon town is one of the best preserved in the country, with roads, alleys, houses, rubbish pits and wells recorded, and large amounts of associated finds. The medieval town has significant standing remains and important archaeological evidence from the late Saxon period onwards. The collections are rich in imported objects, demonstrating the town’s importance as an international trading centre and port, and domestic objects and industrial waste which reflect the everyday life and technological achievements of its inhabitants. The range of domestic and imported goods, particularly pottery and glass, from the households of the wealthy cosmopolitan merchant class of medieval Southampton, for example, is exemplary. The pottery collections are particularly important, including a broad range of local and imported wares, which are of international significance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, new research and fieldwork, since the introduction of planning control work in 1990, has broadened the range of the collections. There is increasing material showing prehistoric activity in the city. Prehistoric worked flints and pottery sherds have been found across the city, associated with ditches, pits and other features. Our knowledge of the Roman town of Clausentum has been increased by new discoveries, such as a warehouse of Samian pottery from France which was destroyed by fire in the late 2<sup>nd</sup> century. An important late 3<sup>rd</sup> century hoard of over 3000 Roman coins, found during building work in 2007, was acquired through the Treasure process in 2011.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Southampton’s  growing role in international trade from the Tudor period onwards is reflected by artifacts linked to the Americas, the Mediterranean, and Africa. The collection includes  much pottery from late 18<sup>th</sup> century rubbish pits when Southampton re-invented itself as a spa town and hosted genteel visitors such as Jane Austen and her family. Local industries included the servicing of commercial shipping, and sugar refining. These archives broaden the range of the collections and the stories they can tell. archives broaden the range of the collections and of the stories they can tell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The object collections are accompanied and complimented by extensive archive collections, the records generated by the process of excavation. These records are of international significance, as they provide the academic depth which makes detailed research on the collections possible. These records include site records, reports and publication texts, photographs, plans and drawings, and increasing amounts of digital data, such as text documents, digital photographs, databases and GIS and ACAD data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collections are well-documented and appear in many local, national and international publications. They are a source of data for researchers from all over the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The archaeological collections also include individual objects of archaeological significance found in the city by gardeners, builders and metal detectorists. In addition, there is a small collection of ancient Egyptian material, some of which was collected by Flinders Petrie; an internationally renowned ancient Nubian statue of the black pharaoh Taharqa, and a small collection of ethnographic material, collected by people from Southampton travelling or working abroad in the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. This material reflected the collecting habits of individuals at the time and needs to be treated with sensitivity towards today’s communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Maritime &amp; Local History</strong></p>
<p>The maritime and local history collection contains objects, pictures, drawings, photographs, ephemera, film, video, oral history recordings and archives that have strong associations with the maritime and local history of Southampton and Southampton Water.</p>
<p>These include</p>
<ul>
<li>Maritime souvenirs and about 4,500 items of maritime ephemera, including menus, wine lists, deck plans, advertising brochures, ship-board newspapers, activity programmes as well as 47 posters, the earliest dating from 1893</li>
<li>Items illustrating the story of Southampton as an eighteenth century spa town, including a sedan chair</li>
<li>Unique holdings of material relating to the <em>Titanic</em> disaster, with a particular focus on the crew of this ship and the Southampton aspects of this global story</li>
<li>Several thousand items of costume and costume accessories, most with a local connection, but also many of a maritime nature, such as merchant navy uniforms</li>
<li>A number of photographic collections of ships and docks related to Southampton, including the ABP collection (c. 40,000 photographs, mostly of Southampton), the Mitchell, Phillips and Kennaway collections (c. 4,500 negatives and photographs) as well as many photograph albums, including both maritime and local photographs</li>
<li>A range of artworks, including a collection of several thousand maritime watercolours and drawings by local artist Arthur Cozens (1880-1947) and many hundred topographical prints</li>
<li>300 ship models, including a 7 meter-long model of Cunard’s Queen Mary as well as a small number of bone models, made during the Napoleonic Wars by French prisoners of war</li>
<li>Maritime furniture and other liner interiors, including marquetry panels from Mauretania and Queen Elizabeth</li>
<li>Several hundred ships’ plans, engineering drawings and other material from local shipyards Day &amp; Summers, Vosper Thornycroft, British Power Boat Company and Camper &amp; Nicholson</li>
<li>Collections relating to the shipping lines Royal Mail Line and Shaw Savill. Both include primarily ephemera and souvenirs, as well as various other items such as photographs and costume</li>
<li>Artefacts relating to domestic life in Southampton, including toys and needlework tools</li>
<li>A reference library, comprising approximately 1000 volumes, relating to ships and shipping</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Archives</strong></p>
<p>The archives collection contains material about Southampton and its people and from further afield. It includes a wide range of written records for Southampton’s history, development and governance from 1199 to the present day, for example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Southampton City Council’s own archives and those of its predecessors</li>
<li>Archives of statutory bodies operating in Southampton</li>
<li>Public Records offered under the terms of the Public Records Acts 1958-67 relating to Southampton and its interests</li>
<li>Southampton manorial and tithe documents offered under the Manorial Documents Rule 1960 and Tithe Act 1936</li>
<li>Ecclesiastical records for Southampton parishes under the Parochial Registers and Records Measure 1978 and a 1966 agreement with the Diocese of Winchester</li>
<li>Archives of individuals, organisations, businesses, institutions germane to the history of Southampton</li>
<li>Extensive oral history collections which capture the personal stories of people who served in the merchant navy, worked in the docks and passed through the City as gateway to empire</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The archive does not usually collect records outside Southampton’s boundaries, with one notable exception of relevance to the city – the Central Index of Merchant Seamen 1918-1941 which covers all British registered ships.</p>

				     	<p><strong>Fine Art Collection</strong></p>
<p>Southampton’s fine art collection, currently comprising 5,000 works of art and “Designated” by the Government in 1998 as possessing pre-eminent national significance, is the finest public collection of art south of London. Robert Chipperfield, councillor, and JP laid the foundation in 1911, bequeathing money to build an art gallery and a separate trust fund for the purchase of a growing art collection. He stipulated that the advice of the Director of the National Gallery should be sought in the use of his fund.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1933 that role was taken up by Kenneth Clark. He wrote a succinct and focussed acquisition policy, still broadly adhered to today: a small collection of old masters, a representative collection of 19th century work, a collection of drawings and watercolours and a growing collection of modern works in oils. In 1925 F.W Smith, a councillor involved in the new gallery project bequeathed a further fund for the purchase of paintings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A professional curator, Loraine Conran, was appointed when the new gallery opened to the public in 1939. It was his successor, Maurice Palmer, whose extensive, consistent and visionary purchasing over 20 years developed the collection into the rounded form it has today. The historic part of the collection was built up from the 1930s to 1975. Then the high cost of Monet’s <em>The Church at Vetheuil</em> necessitated a change of direction. From that time the priority switched to the purchase of work by rising star British contemporary artists. The adviser also changed to a senior Tate curator knowledgeable in the field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collection has been almost entirely built up with private bequest funds, gifts and bequests of artwork. In 1963, gallery owner and dealer, Arthur Jeffress bequeathed 99 works to Southampton, many rare and significant, and in 2002 Dr David Brown (the gallery’s first Tate, modern adviser) bequeathed 220 modern works of art including 15 works by St Ives artist Roger Hilton. The Orris Bequest Fund was added in 1998 and the Dr David and Liza Brown Bequest Fund in 2002 (administered by the Art Fund). More recently, over 100 prints, drawings and paintings were acquired through the Schlee bequest in 2013. The gallery also benefits from gifts from individual artists of their own work, reflecting the high regard in which the collection is held. Outside organisations such as the Art Fund, the Contemporary Art Society, the Pilgrim Trust and the Dannatt Trust as well as the Friends of Southampton Museums and Galleries have also supported the Gallery through important gifts.</p>

<p><strong>Museum Collection</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>History of the Archaeology Collection</strong></p>
<p>The archaeology collections have their origins in the collections of Tudor House Museum, established as the city’s first museum in 1912. The early collections were very eclectic, representing a general interest in things historic or curious as well as those with particular local connections. They included prehistoric axeheads and Roman and Saxon material recovered from building sites in the town. These collections also included ancient Egyptian material and ethnographic objects brought back to the city by travellers and explorers. The shape of these early collections was much influenced by the museum’s first Honorary Curator, R.E. Nicholas, who donated items from his own collections, and persuaded many others to follow suit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Systematic excavation began in the 1930s with early work at Bitterne Manor, the site of Roman Clausentum, and increasing momentum developed on bombed sites in the Old Town in the 1950s and 1960s. These excavations produced large quantities of Saxon and medieval material, providing a nationally significant resource for the study of everyday life in the medieval town and its Saxon predecessor, Hamwic. A new Museum of Archaeology was opened at God’s House Tower in 1961 to showcase these important collections, and this museum became the recognised repository for all archaeological material produced in the city. This museum closed in 2011 and the collections transferred into other Council sites. The building is now occupied by ‘a space arts’ and opened as a new arts and heritage centre in 2019.</p>
<p>As the pace of development has increased, so have opportunities for excavation and recording. Since 1990, planning regulations has enabled archaeological recording on hundreds of sites across the city, increasing the range and scope of material and broadening our understanding of the city’s past. These collections now comprise over half a million items, and their national significance was officially recognised in 1998 when they were awarded Designated status, positioning them within the country’s top ten archaeological collections outside London. Arts Council England’s publication on Designated Outstanding collections (2014) states “The size and range of the archaeology collections reflect the importance of Southampton in the past and at present, and the 50 years of systematic archaeological investigations in the city.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>History of the Maritime and Local History collection</strong></p>
<p>Like the archaeology collections, the maritime and local history collections have their origins in the collections of Tudor House Museum, which opened in 1912 as the city’s first museum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The early collections were wide-ranging and eclectic and included natural history specimens, archaeology and ‘curios’ as well as artefacts relating to the city’s maritime and local history. A number of items were transferred to the museum from other Council departments, such as two banners from local volunteer regiments, dating from about 1802 and the town stocks, transferred in 1912 from the Town Clerk’s Department. A significant number of items were acquired from William Burrough Hill, a local collector and auctioneer. Among these were a collection of 63 watercolours by William Cooper, depicting the Old Town in the 1890s, immediately before extensive slum clearance took place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collections developed, primarily through passive collecting (donations and bequests), but included significant items, such as the ceremonial sword belonging to <em>Titanic</em>’s late Captain Smith, which was donated by his wife and daughter. The significance of the rich maritime holdings was reflected in the opening of a new Maritime Museum in 1964 to showcase this aspect of Southampton’s history. The museum was located in a former medieval wool house near the Town Quay (currently occupied by the Dancing Man Brewery).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 1980s and 1990s saw extensive collecting of maritime and local history material. Southampton was changing rapidly with industry and manufacturing being replaced with retail and leisure. Groups of industrial and maritime artefacts were collected from several closing businesses, including Pirelli Cable Works and the Vosper Thornycroft Shipyard. Other significant donations were received during this period, including a collection of more than 300 historic dresses and costume accessories, donated by Miss Cozens, a local collector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2012, a new maritime museum was opened in the former Law Courts and Central Police Station. The displays in the new museum, SeaCity Museum, showcase the existing rich and varied maritime and local history collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Between 2018 and 2022, as part of the museum service’s ACE-funded National Portfolio Organisation project, extensive work was undertaken to widen the diversity represented in the collections. This included contemporary collecting projects focusing on for example, Southampton’s LGBT community and the effects of Covid on local people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>History of the Archive collection</strong></p>
<p>During the early 20<sup>th</sup> century there had been increasing pressure from citizens and historians throughout the country worried about a lack of access to and safe provision for written historical material. In Southampton the main demonstration of the interest in local archives came via the newly formed</p>
<p>Southampton Record Society under the editorship of Professor Fossy John Cobb Hearnshaw. Based at the now University of Southampton, it began publishing editions of early borough records – starting with Court Leet records, borrowing material from the then Audit House and working on them at home. Southampton opened its Record Office in 1953 to the public staffed by one archivist and having only a handful of researchers a year. At that time the collections were small and included only the records of the local authority and its predecessor bodies; collections, staff and visitors were all housed in one windowless, basement room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the collections have greatly expanded to include material from private individuals, public bodies, institutions, societies, churches and other sources. They are consulted by individuals from Southampton, and further afield, who visit the archives to pursue their interest in family history, educational projects, social, economic history and maritime history. This commitment to Southampton’s history was one of the grounds on which Southampton petitioned for and was awarded City Status in 1964. The reasons for the successful application included the ‘importance of the town in the shipping world’ …‘public spirit’…. ‘maintenance of historical records and customs, and the existence of a true sense of citizenship’. Special mention was also made of the ‘long history of public administration and the efficiency of municipal services’ – still reflected today in the provision of a records management service to the authority to improve and maintain this efficiency and to meet demands of legislation.</p>
<p>In 2008 the collection of the Southampton Oral History Unit were given to the archives. The collection originates from a project begun in 1983 to record the life histories of Southampton people. Further projects included memories of the city’s African-Caribbean community, women in World War 1, and dock workers. This direct voice of the recent past complemented written and object collections and by 1986 oral history was an accepted part of the approach to documenting the recent past. The collections hold 800 recordings and over 5,000 related photographs documenting the lives of seafarers, shipyard workers, <em>Titanic</em> survivors, and local communities.</p>

				     	<h2>Maritime Collection</h2>
<p>The maritime collection is unusually strong for a local museum, as a result of the museums rights over the 16th century wreck, thought to be a Venetian trading vessel, lying off Teignmouth Church Rocks. Diving on the wreck has produced many interesting artefacts which are in the museum including bronze cannons and shot; a cooking pot; animal bones; a collection of iron chains; copper pots; and pottery. There are also research papers written about the wreck. There is also a gun raised from the wreck of the Peronne, a ship sunk off Teignmouth during the First World War. Other artefacts represent the local lifeboat, coastguard service and fishing industry.</p>

				     	<p>The Thackray Museum of Medicine collection encompasses three main areas: objects, library and archival material. The majority of the collection dates from the 18<sup>th</sup> century to the present day, but there are small collections of Roman, medieval and early modern objects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Object Collection</strong></p>
<p>The object collection comprises over 45,000 objects. Areas of particular strength include:</p>
<p>Surgical instruments and implants from the 1600s to the present day, with the period 1870- 1970 particularly strongly represented. The collection includes products from over 20 different countries, particularly British, German and French instruments. One strongly represented implant is the Charnley hip, the first truly successful total hip replacement, designed in collaboration with Chas. F. Thackray Ltd.</p>
<p>The John F. Wilkinson collection of British and European drug jars, which incorporates the largest collection of English Delftware drug jars in Britain, possibly in the world. Other apothecary and pharmaceutical holdings include materia medica in the form of dried plant and mineral specimens, pill-making and weighing equipment, and thousands of tablets, ampoules and bottles from the 19<sup>th</sup> to 21<sup>st</sup> centuries.</p>
<p>Disability aids, including prosthetic limbs, wheelchairs, spectacles, and a huge collection of hearing aids and audiological testing equipment, from 19<sup>th</sup> century acoustic fans and ear trumpets to 21<sup>st</sup>-century cochlear implants.</p>
<p>Hospital equipment and furniture from the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, including British anaesthetic apparatus; diagnostic equipment like x-ray machines; and ward staples, including urinals, bedpans and dressing trays.</p>
<p>Uniforms worn by a range of healthcare providers from the First World War onwards. The textile collection also holds two large AIDS memorial quilts made in Leeds during workshops facilitated by BHA Leeds Skyline, a local HIV support service.</p>
<p>A large collection of apothecary tokens, advertising tokens and medals dating from the 17<sup>th</sup> to 20<sup>th</sup> centuries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Library Collection</strong></p>
<p>The Library collection encompasses 10,800 books and 17,000 medical trade catalogues featuring a wide variety of surgical and healthcare products, making it one of the largest collections of medical trade literature in the UK. The majority of the holdings are in English, but numerous languages are represented, particularly German, French and Latin.</p>
<p>Highlights include surgical manuals dating from the 1599 onwards; early catalogues and public information books promoting contraception; quack literature, including over 200 volumes relating to the pseudo-science of phrenology; medical journals from the 19<sup>th</sup> to 21<sup>st</sup> centuries; and thousands of reference books covering the history of medicine, including first aid, midwifery, and pharmacology.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Archive Collection</strong></p>
<p>The archive contains over 10,000 items and is made up of separate collections, largely relating to medical supply companies and personal papers of doctors, nurses and surgeons. The most significant collection is the archives of the Chas. F. Thackray Company (circa 30 boxes), the former Leeds-based medical supplies company. The Thackray company archive covers the life of the firm from 1902-1990 and contains items such as trade catalogues, notebooks, instrument drawings and press cuttings.</p>
<p>Other major collections held by the museum’s archive include archives of the Oxford Knee (circa 79 boxes), relating to the development of the Oxford Partial Knee implant, one of the most widely used and clinically proven partial knee replacements in the world; the Scholl archive of catalogues, advertising material and company magazines relating to foot comfort products; records relating to Lindsey and Sons, a company which built surgical appliances, including special footwear; the Calenduline Company, a Chicago-based company that manufactured treatments for the eye and throat; the Eschmann company, who were pioneers in making operating tables; and the Downs Surgical Limited company – material relating to an instrument manufacturing company who were pioneers in the manufacture of high-quality medical instruments, particularly those used in ear, nose and throat surgery.</p>
<p>The archive contains over 50 collections of personal papers and photographs of doctors, nurses and surgeons who largely worked in Leeds. Names of surgeons whose papers we hold include Herbert Agar, Henry Shucksmith, Leslie Pyrah and William Blair-Bell, while the archive holds papers relating to Dr Michael Martin OBE, who worked for the Royal National Institute of the Deaf for 35 years, as well as papers relating to Dr J.F. Wilkinson, relating to his life and work as a haematologist and as a collector of apothecary jars.</p>
<p>Other significant material in the archive includes collections of dispensed prescriptions, pharmacy day books, invoices, correspondence, promotional posters, letters and postcards, business cards, packaging material, flyers, patents and annotated literature. The collection also contains recipe books compiled by individuals between the 17<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries, containing handwritten lists of formulae for food, drink, medicines and remedies.</p>

				     	<p>The Thackray Museum of Medicine is named after Chas. F. Thackray Ltd, a medical supply company founded in 1902. Paul Thackray, a director of the company and grandson of the founder, formed a private collection around 1984. This initial collection was focused on the trade and manufacture of surgical instruments and implants, reflecting the interests of the firm. When Chas. F. Thackray Ltd was sold in 1990, Paul Thackray donated his collection of objects, along with the Thackray company archive and a growing library, to create a small museum, which opened to the public in 1997.</p>
<p>The collection’s focus has broadened significantly in the years since its foundation, and it now covers the wider story of medicine and healthcare. The museum continues to actively collect, aiming to fill out underrepresented areas and reflect new medical innovations.</p>

				     	<p>From the foundation of Torquay Museum by the Torquay Natural History Society in 1844 until the 1920’s, the Museum maintained a policy of acquiring material illustrating the geology, natural history, archaeology, and social history of Devon and in particular specialised in material excavated from local caves which received international attention. From the 1920’s the Museum increasingly acquired material from outside Devon and outside Britain, especially in the fields of natural history, ethnography and archaeology. This period has seen spectacular growth in the more local collections of Devon Folk Life and Pictorial Records (mainly local photographs, prints etc.).</p>

				     	<h2>Designated Collection</h2>
<p>The Designated Quaternary Collection and Archive is comprised of over 30,000 specimens and an associated archive (notably the John MacEnery and William Pengelly manuscripts of the 19th century). Torquay Museum and Torquay Natural History Society have been intimately associated with collecting, documenting and preserving prehistoric remains from the caves of South Devon ever since 1845, something which is actively continued to this day.</p>
<h2>Devon archaeology</h2>
<p>As well as the designated material the museum also holds a broader collection of archaeology from Devon. This includes material from a number of open sites excavated in the 20th century, notably Milber Down, Dainton, and Stoke Gabriel and many miscellaneous small finds from the Dartmoor and South Devon area. In recent years the museum has also acquired finds from a newly discovered Roman site at Ipplepen.</p>
<h2>British archaeology</h2>
<p>The collections of non-Devon British archaeology comprise mainly prehistoric stone artefacts and a miscellany of small finds.</p>
<h2>Foreign archaeology</h2>
<p>There are modest sized collections of Egyptian, Roman, Cypriot and Etruscan archaeology and other miscellaneous objects from the Mediterranean area.</p>
<h2>Ethnography</h2>
<p>The Museum has an ethnographic collection of about 2,800 objects, half of which were amassed by one man, Dr Charles Paget-Blake. The collections are particularly rich in Chinese and Oceanic material. The ‘Explorers’ gallery draws heavily upon many of these artefacts.</p>
<h2>Social history</h2>
<p>The Museum has extensive collections which tend to fall into two divisions – the Devon Folk Collections and a miscellany of everyday social history objects ranging from the Victorian to World War II period. The Devon Folk Collection is extremely rich in domestic objects from Devon farmhouses, mainly of 17th – 19th century date. It is regarded as being of both regional and national importance. The remaining social history collection comprises of a miscellany of costume, costume accessories, numismatics, domestic objects, etc., broadly illustrative of everyday life from the Victorian period to WW II. These items have no special association with Torbay.</p>
<h2>Local history</h2>
<p>The Museum has large collections of photographs, prints, watercolours, drawings and ephemera relating to Torbay and the neighbourhood, which form the best source available for local history study of the area. There is also a particularly good photographic archive of Dartmoor dating to the beginning of the 20th century. The collections also contain many examples of pottery from the local Torquay potteries and other local products such as objects made from local ‘marble’. Apart from these ‘applied art’ objects the collections are rather poor in 3-D local history objects.</p>
<h2>Ceramics</h2>
<p>Apart from the extensive collection of material from the Torquay potteries mentioned above, the Museum has a modest collection of English, continental and oriental ceramics of some note. The collection includes a particularly fine number of Staffordshire dogs associated with the Devon Folk Collection.</p>
<h2>Geology</h2>
<p>The geology holdings comprise very large collections of Devon palaeontology (mainly Devonian fossils and Pleistocene mammal fossils(?)), modest collections of mainly Devon rocks and a modest worldwide collection of minerals. The palaeontology collections are of international, regional and national importance. The remainder of the geology collections are of regional importance.</p>
<h2>Zoology</h2>
<p>There are large British and foreign collections of entomology (mainly Lepidoptera) and conchology and smaller collections of vertebrates (especially birds) and marine invertebrates. There also exists a modest sized collection of zoological microscopial slides.</p>
<h2>Botany</h2>
<p>The Museum has a large herbarium, rich in British and foreign material, with some particularly important local collections (e.g. marine algae).</p>
<h2>Archives</h2>
<p>The Museum has collections of letters, manuscripts, albums and personalia associated with prominent figures associated with the history of the Museum and Society (e.g. William Pengelly).</p>

				     	<p>The collections are the product of hundreds of years of collecting, driven by the research and teaching activities of staff and the activities of graduates and other people. Items have been acquired by the University and its constituent institutions from their foundation in 1495. A library has been in existence since the earliest years, while museums were established in the 18th century in King’s College and Marischal College. The collections are of great local and international importance. They have a deep cohesion and quality stemming from the intellectual interests of staff, students and graduates, augmented by material from individuals, families, businesses and organisations associated with the University and the North-East of Scotland (approximating to the local authority areas of Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire and Moray). Consequently, the collection largely reflects historic collecting practices and does not fully represent the diversity of the University today. The collections are managed together as University Collections within the Directorate of Digital and Information Services with the aim of enhancing their care and accessibility.</p>
<p>The Archives are the central place for the curation of the historic records of the University, its predecessors, and affiliated bodies, augmented by the gift, loan and purchase of manuscripts and archives of individuals, families, businesses and organisations associated with the University and the North-East of Scotland. The rare book and printed collections were identified as a distinct special collection in the 1970s and later managed alongside the University’s archives. The University Collections Centre is an archive repository recognised by the National Archives and the National Records of Scotland (reference GB 0231). The museum collections combine several former departmental collections with centrally managed art and heritage collections, now Accredited as three collections covering a wide range of Human Culture, Medicine and Health, and the Natural Sciences. The entire museum collection was awarded the status of a Recognised Collection of National Significance by the Scottish Government in 2007.</p>

<h2>Rare books and printed collections</h2>
<p>University Collections currently exercises curatorial responsibility for over 230,000 rare books in the university library collections. These comprise all printed scientific and topographical books printed to 1860; books in other subjects to 1840, and other printed materials deemed valuable or otherwise important from 1860 to the present, by virtue of association of author or provenance or of congruence of subject with the University of Aberdeen and/or the North-East of Scotland. These are classified as: Inc (Incunabula); π or Pi (pre-1600 Continental, pre-1640 English and pre-1780 Scottish); SB (other pre 1841 material, plus scientific and medical titles pre-1861); SBL (examples of local printing to 1800); Lib R (rare titles, mostly mid- to late 19th century); Items of local interest, relating to the University or to economic, political, social, cultural or topographical aspects of Aberdeen or to North-East Scotland; Items associated with significant individuals, or organisations, related to the University, Aberdeen, or North-East Scotland. Among the collections are over 45 distinct collections, covering a diverse range of subjects, from Classical literature to pharmacology. Recognised strengths include Charles Dickens, Hebraica and Judaica, history of science, including medicine, Jacobitism (centred on the MacBean collection), rail and other transport within North-East Scotland (centred on the O’Dell collection), Walter Scott, (centred on the Bernard C. Lloyd Walter Scott collection), theology, typography, and Victorian fiction and poetry. In addition, curatorial responsibility is exercised for reference copies of University theses.</p>
<h2>Human Culture museum collections</h2>
<p>The University’s cultural museum collections are of particular significance, reflecting both North-East Scotland and the results of collecting by graduates and staff across the World, mainly during the 19th and early 20th centuries: Scottish historical collections reflecting the history of the University, North-East culture and militaria; Archaeological collections of prehistoric and early historic material from North-East Scotland; Fine Art, particularly Early Modern Scottish painting, 17th-20th century portraiture, 19th and 20th century prints, and a collection of 20th century works by Scottish Colourists based on a bequest by Eric Linklater; Archaeological collections from Italy, Egypt and Central America, and more modern cultural material from North and South America, South and East Asia, South, East and West Africa, Australia, the Pacific, and the Balkans; Numismatics, with particular strengths in Classical coins, Scottish coins and communion tokens, commemorative and prize medals, but also trade tokens, jetons and beggars’ badges; Historic scientific instruments, particularly natural philosophy in Aberdeen from the 18th to later 20th centuries</p>
<h2>Medicine and Health museum collections</h2>
<p>The collection consists of spirit-preserved anatomical and pathological specimens, anatomical and pathological models, and drawings and watercolours of dissections, and surgical instruments deriving from the former Surgery Museum. Acquisition and management of parts of the collection is restricted by the Anatomy Acts, as amended by the Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006.</p>
<h2>Natural Science museum collections</h2>
<p>The Geology collection includes items from localities which are no longer available for collecting and specimens with associated petrographic thin sections and chemical analyses.</p>
<p>Palaeontology, including over 600 &#8216;Type and Figured&#8217; specimens, with strengths in fossil corals and Bryozoa and early reptiles, and the internationally-renowned Early Devonian Rhynie chert; Minerals, particularly from the British Isles; The rock collection contains material of worldwide origin, with a particular strength in northern Scotland. The Herbarium is internationally important and worldwide in scope, with good provenance information and notes made by researchers relating to individual specimens: A large representative collection of Scottish material, including algae, fungi, and lichens; Collections from southern Asia, notably a special emphasis on Thailand, including over 400 type specimens collected by A. F. G. Kerr and W. G. Craib, and a collection of vascular plants from northern India, including type specimens, collected by H. H. Haines; A small but historically important collection of vascular plants from Antarctica collected during the 1922 Shackleton-Rowett Expedition and the 1967 British Antarctic Survey; Approximately 5000 vascular plant specimens from North America and Canada collected by V. C. Wynne-Edwards and other staff. The Zoology collection includes a wide range of material that is worldwide in scope, covering protozoa to the great whales: Mammal and bird mounted taxidermy and study skins; Fluid-preserved specimens; Insect collections and collections of slides; Skeletal material, originally part of the comparative anatomical collections; Biological models, including work by Blaschka, Brendel and Auzoux.</p>

				     	<h2>Museum Collections</h2>
<p>The Museum Collections encompass approximately 115,000 items in the fields of Anatomy and Pathology, Chemistry, Geology, Historic Scientific Instruments, Psychology, Zoology, Ethnographic and Amerindian material and the Heritage Collections (fine art, silver, textiles and furniture, archaeology, numismatics). The Heritage, Chemistry and Scientific Instrument Collections are Recognised Collections of National Significance under the scheme administered by Museums Galleries Scotland on behalf of the Scottish Government.</p>
<h2>Archival Collections</h2>
<p>The archival collections comprise the University’s institutional records (sometimes called the muniments) and the manuscripts. The earliest muniments date from the early 13th century, before the foundation of the University in the early 15th century. They include a huge range of material, including title deeds on vellum, minutes, accounts, matriculation and graduation records and lists of students, maps and plans, photographs, administrative files and correspondence. The most recent muniments were created and are managed digitally. The University’s collection of manuscripts ranges in date and subject from Greek papyri and medieval philosophical treatises to modern business papers. The Collection is particularly strong in material relating to the North-East Fife, including estate, architectural and business records as local church and burgh records. They form the primary resource for research into individuals or studies connected with the University, and the history of science, literature and theology. There is a small, but high-quality, collection of non-European material in a variety of languages.</p>
<h2>Photographic Collections</h2>
<p>The Photographic Collection numbers nearly two million images which exist in a wide variety of formats: negatives, slides, prints, postcards, albums and born digital image files; and cover a wide variety of subject areas from social documentary to travel and exploration. Collections date from the earliest days of photographic experimentation in the 1840s, through to contemporary acquisitions, and include several notable photographers and photographic firms. As such they form a nationally and internationally significant account of the history of photography, and the important role of St Andrews and Scotland as a major hub for photographic activity.</p>
<h2>Rare Book Collections</h2>
<p>The Rare Book collection contains approximately 210,000 volumes. From 1710 to 1837, the Library was entitled to a copy of every book printed in Britain under the Copyright Deposit Act, as a result of which it is particularly strong in 18th century material, with a special emphasis on books relating to the Scottish Enlightenment. The main subject areas of the collections are theology, classics, history, English and Scottish literature, philosophy, science and medicine. There are about 180 incunabula, 5,000 16th century books, 7,000 17th century books, as well as a substantial general collection of 18th and 19th century items. The collection is also constituted of a number of personal and named collections which the University has received as donations.</p>

				     	<h2>ASIAN DEPARTMENT</h2>
<p>The Asian Department was created in 2001 by bringing together the Indian and South-East Asian and East Asian collections with the Museum&#8217;s holdings of material from the Middle East, giving the Museum a coherent strategy for all its Asian collections for the first time. The collections, which together number about 150,000 objects, are extremely broad in scope chronologically, geographically and in terms of media. They include paintings in oil, watercolour and ink on canvas, paper and cloth; prints and photography; sculpture and carvings in stone, metal, wood, ivory, jade and other hardstones; metalwork and jewellery; arms and armour; dress, textiles and carpets; ceramics and glass; furniture and lacquer.</p>
<p>The cultures of Asia are of great historical depth, while at different times and in different ways they have also both influenced, and been influenced by, western art and culture. Today, Asia is undergoing rapid change and is of great economic, political and cultural significance. The V&amp;A thus has an important role to play in helping to interpret both historical and contemporary Asian culture to a growing and changing audience of national and international visitors.</p>
<p>The V&amp;A&#8217;s world-class Asian collections, together with those of institutions such as the British Museum and the British Library, make London one of the most important centres for the appreciation and study of Asian art and culture outside the various countries of origin. The V&amp;A&#8217;s strengths lie in the decorative arts and design history, complementing the archaeological focus and numismatic strengths of the British Museum, and the British Library&#8217;s focus on manuscripts and the printed book. There is considerable consultation with other institutions in London and throughout the UK as we continue to develop our holdings with a national framework in mind.</p>
<p>We continue to build and develop our collections through the acquisition of objects that illustrate and document the history and practice of art and design throughout Asia. In spheres where designers are active in international arenas, we work in consultation and collaboration with the V&amp;A&#8217;s other curatorial departments. For all our acquisitions we pay close attention to provenance and follow UNESCO protocols.</p>
<h3>South, South-East Asia and the Himalayas</h3>
<p>The collections from the South Asian subcontinent (India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) range from ca. 3,000 BC to the present and number ca. 60,000 objects. The Museum also holds rich collections from the Himalayan region (Sikkim, Bhutan, Nepal and Tibet ca. 1,500 objects) and from most regions of SouthEast Asia (Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Indonesia, ca. 3,500 objects).</p>
<p>The South and South-East Asian collections have their origins in the Museum of the East India Company.</p>
<p>In the second half of the 19<sup>th </sup>century the ‘India Museum&#8217; was transferred to the newly established India Office and its broadly based historical collections were developed with a particular focus on arts, manufactures, and economic products, largely through acquisitions from international exhibitions. By the 1870s they included an unrivalled assemblage of contemporary decorative arts from all of what was then considered ‘Greater India&#8217;, i.e. those areas of South-East Asia and the Himalayan regions that had historically been influenced by India, or which were governed by British India. In 1879 the India Museum was dispersed, and its holdings came to South Kensington, where they joined the collections that had been developed at the Museum since initial acquisitions were made at the Great Exhibition of 1851.</p>
<p>When the V&amp;A&#8217;s collections were rationalised in 1909 and divided into material-based departments, the South Asian collections continued to be known as the ‘India Museum&#8217; and were displayed in 20 rooms of the Eastern Galleries on the west side of Exhibition Road. In the mid-1950s, the Eastern Galleries were demolished, and the collection&#8217;s displays, now much reduced in scale, were moved to the main V&amp;A building. The broad pattern of acquiring both historical and contemporary sculpture, painting and decorative arts and design has continued to this day resulting in a collection that is one of the largest and most important in the world.</p>
<p>The V&amp;A&#8217;s collection of Mughal court arts includes some of the most important pieces in the world and the collection of South Asian textiles (ca.10,000 items) is the largest and most important outside the region itself. A few very significant artefacts from the courts of Tipu Sultan and Maharaja Ranjit Singh make the V&amp;A an important centre of study in both these fields. The collections of South Asian paintings and works on paper (ca. 5,000) and sculpture (ca. 5,000) are, along with those of the British Library and the British Museum respectively, among the finest in the western world. The V&amp;A&#8217;s distinctive strengths also include furniture (ca. 300), musical instruments (ca. 200) and objects relating to the performing arts. The collection is strong in metalwork, arms and armour, and decorative arts of the second half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, especially items made for exhibition purposes, but does not comprehensively cover earlier periods. The Museum has smaller collections of works by 20<sup>th</sup> &#8211; and 21<sup>st</sup>-century artists and designers, (both those based in the Indian subcontinent and of South Asian origin working in the UK) and a significant holding of 20<sup>th</sup>-century and contemporary Indian film posters – a genre which is important to an understanding of the modern and contemporary visual world of South Asia.</p>
<p>In addition to the ca. 60,000 objects from South Asia already cited, the archive collection of 19<sup>th</sup>-century (predominantly architectural site) photographs of South Asia, (ca. 20,000 prints and a large collection of negatives), along with photographic documentation of items of Indian art elsewhere in the V&amp;A, is of enormous value.</p>
<p>The Himalayan collection consists primarily of sculpture, tangkas (painted scrolls), and ritual and domestic vessels, but also includes important items of dress, personal ornament, arms and armour.</p>
<p>From South-East Asia, the V&amp;A holds a significant collection of 19<sup>th</sup>-century material from Burma (Myanmar) and further strengths include a good collection of textiles and the UK&#8217;s most important collections of early sculptures from Indonesia, Thailand, Burma and Cambodia, and of metalwork from mainland South-East Asia.</p>
<p>In the case of the historical collections, we aim to acquire selective and securely provenanced examples of sculpture of the Gupta and medieval periods; court art from the 16<sup>th</sup> to 19<sup>th</sup> century; paintings from both religious and secular traditions, early examples of South Asian textiles (including trade textiles); examples of 18<sup>th</sup> &#8211; and 19<sup>th</sup>-century furniture, metalwork and jewellery; and objects made for everyday use. One particular aim is to acquire objects that will enrich rotation displays in the South Asia Gallery in areas where there are few examples in the collection, such as Sultanate, Deccani and pre-Mughal Hindu painting. Opportunities will also be sought to acquire notable examples of significant genres of art from particular traditions, such as the Jain religion, where these are not well represented in the collection. We also hope to strengthen the Himalayan collection by the judicious addition of examples of early painting (12<sup>th</sup>-14<sup>th</sup> centuries) and sculpture, and of early 20<sup>th</sup>-century textiles and jewellery which represent the traditional culture of the region. Regarding South-East Asia, we aim to build on our holdings of sculpture, painted works, textiles and jewellery.</p>
<p>In the case of modern and contemporary works, we aim to increase our South Asian holdings in all media to reflect changes in society, technology and the use of raw materials. Recent years have seen the rapid development of a South Asian fashion industry, much of it based on a revival and elaboration of indigenous types of dress. We aim to collect and document key examples of modern and contemporary clothing, fashion and textiles. We also aim to acquire contemporary paintings, drawings and prints and examples of craft and product design relating to the domestic interior. With artists and designers whose approach is self-consciously international, we collaborate and consult with the V&amp;A&#8217;s western collections. We are, for example, working with colleagues in the Photography Section of the Word and Image Department on a project to acquire contemporary South Asian photography. Regarding the Himalayas and South-East Asia, we plan to focus on the major strengths of the collections by acquiring selective examples of contemporary paintings and decorative arts, particularly textiles and jewellery.</p>
<h3>East Asia</h3>
<p>The collections from East Asia consist of ca. 68,000 items from China, Japan and Korea. They include objects from China (ca. 18,200 items) ranging from archaeological material of the 4<sup>th</sup> millennium BC to 21<sup>st</sup>-century items, Japanese material (ca. 48,850 items) primarily from the 16<sup>th </sup>century to the present, and Korean material (ca. 950 items) from the Three Kingdoms period (57BC-668AD) to the present.</p>
<p>The Museum has collected material from East Asia since its inception. Important donations and bequests during the course of the 20<sup>th</sup> century &#8211; including from the Salting, Eumorfopoulos, Hildburgh, Alexander and Le Blond collections &#8211; coupled with determined and dedicated collecting by individual curators, led to major strengths. It was not until 1970, however, that the V&amp;A&#8217;s East Asian collections were brought together under the care of specialist curators. These now constitute the largest and most extensive museum collection of East Asian ceramics (totalling ca. 9,000 items) and East Asian furniture and textiles (over 4,000) in the UK, while the collections of Chinese export art and Japanese prints (over 30,000), <em>inrō </em>(ca. 570 items) and lacquer (ca.2,000 items) are among the finest in the western world. Following the generous gift from Edwin Davies, CBE, the V&amp;A now has the largest and most comprehensive collection of Japanese cloisonné enamels of any museum in the world, an area in which we continue to actively acquire. Further strengths are Chinese metalwork and carvings (ca. 1,500 items), Japanese <em>netsuke</em> (ca.860 items) and swords and sword fittings (over 5,000 items). The V&amp;A has also built up a strong Korean collection despite the scarce availability of Korean artefacts during the colonial period (1910-45), Korean War (1950-53) and military regimes. Excellent ceramics, textiles, metalwork, furniture and lacquer have been acquired through generous donations and strategic purchases. We continue to collect historical material selectively to augment and enrich our existing collections and to allow for the rotation of sensitive material such as paintings, textiles and dress.</p>
<p>Since 1980, there has been a consistent focus on modern and contemporary collecting. Chinese objects have been collected in a conscious effort to map the period and now constitute an impressive group perhaps unmatched outside China. We continue to actively collect contemporary Chinese art and design, particularly in the spheres of ceramics and dress. Japanese studio crafts are another particular strength, and our collection continues to grow. We also actively collect contemporary Japanese dress, interior and product design. Contemporary Korean ceramics and works in other media have also been steadily acquired since the establishment of the Korean Gallery in 1992, the first of its kind in London. Since the appointment of a full-time specialist curator for Korea in 2012 we have been able to pursue a more proactive collecting strategy aimed at the acquisition of objects that reveal innovative use of traditional cultural heritage and that showcase the dynamic contemporary craft and design scene in Korea, particularly in the fields of textiles and dress, ceramics, lacquer, metalwork and paper. We work closely with the other curatorial departments of the Museum in the acquisition of works by East Asian designers active in international arenas.</p>
<h3>Middle East</h3>
<p>The V&amp;A holds over 18,000 items from the Middle East in the Islamic period. Until 2002, when staff with relevant expertise were appointed to the Asian Department, this world-class collection remained divided among the Museum&#8217;s materials-based departments. Transfer of the Middle Eastern collections to the Asian Department&#8217;s care has been carried out in tandem with gallery development and other projects and is now well advanced.</p>
<p>The importance of the V&amp;A collection in the field of Islamic art from the Middle East lies partly in its size and quality but also in the early date at which the collecting process began. The V&amp;A was the first institution in the world to form a systematic and purposeful collection of Islamic art, the founders of the Museum seeing it as a key source for the reform of British design. Objects were first acquired by purchase from the European market and from international expositions and then, from the 1860s, by sending agents into the field. The foundation of the outstanding Iranian collections, for example, was the acquisition of pieces for the Museum by Sir Robert Murdoch Smith in Iran in the 1870s and 80s. The Museum also received major bequests from private collectors such as George Salting. Collecting continued on a less intensive scale after World War I, with a significant spate of acquisitions in the 1980s, when a number of major items were purchased at auction.</p>
<p>In date, the collections begin with the rise of Islam in the 7th century. They are strongest in their representation of Iran, Turkey, Egypt, Syria and Iraq, but also include objects from Spain under Muslim rule, North Africa (Morocco to Libya), the Caucasus republics, and Afghanistan and the former Soviet Central Asia, most notably Uzbekistan. The collections include holdings of ceramics, textiles, metalwork and woodwork that are remarkable for their size and range, and the ceramics collection is internationally the most important and comprehensive of its kind (3,500 objects and ca. 8,000 sherds). It is particularly strong in Iranian wares and tiles of all countries. The textiles collection is of equally substantial range and importance (ca. 3,600 items) while the metalwork collection, which includes vessels, jewellery, and arms and armour, is also of world importance. The woodwork collection has areas of significance such as Mamluk carved wood. There are also smaller but significant collections of carving in ivory, rock crystal and stone, which include the unrivalled Fatimid rock crystal ewer. The arts of the book and graphic arts have not generally been a central concern of the Museum, but some areas of the collection, such as the holdings of Iranian architectural drawings from the 19th century, are of great importance. The Museum also has important holdings of architectural casts and one-for-one copies of 17th-century tilework from Isfahan, made in 1876.</p>
<p>Collecting of Middle Eastern material falls into two categories. On the one hand, we seek to augment the historical collection by acquiring in fields not adequately represented. On the other, we have begun to collect modern and contemporary art and design from scratch.</p>
<p>In terms of our historical collections, there are significant omissions. For instance, we wish to build on our good collection of metalwork, by acquiring objects made before the 13<sup>th</sup> century and, in the area of non-Iranian metalwork, after the 16<sup>th</sup> century. We also aim to collect items that illustrate production methods that are specific to our region and relevant to our collections and that have wider social or art historical meaning. Another issue to be addressed is the skewing of our 18<sup>th</sup> and 19th-century collections towards tradition and away from modernity and we have begun to collect items from this period that show a full range of themes, both modern and traditional, and that can be seen as the forerunners of art and design in the 20th century.</p>
<p>In collecting the 20th and 21st centuries, we seek items that reflect both the major currents in art and design in the region as well as political and social life more generally. Another major concern is the way in which contemporary artists and designers are inspired by Islamic tradition. This is the theme of the Jameel Prize, a biennial international award and, along with other contemporary works, we aim to acquire pieces from the Prize exhibitions that are produced by artists and designers from the Middle East.</p>
<p>In making 20th- and 21st-century acquisitions, the Asia Department works with colleagues within the Museum and with other national and regional institutions. The Museum&#8217;s collection of contemporary photography from the Middle East, for example, is held by the Photography section of the Word and Image Department, but it was formed with our assistance and the co-operation of the British Museum, with most of the acquisitions generously funded by The Art Fund</p>
<h2>DESIGN, ARCHITECTURE AND DIGITAL DEPARTMENT</h2>
<p>The Design, Architecture and Digital Department (DAD), formed in 2015, is the youngest of the V&amp;A&#8217;s collecting departments. DAD collections encompass industrial, product, furniture and digital design, architecture and urbanism.</p>
<p>In its collecting, DAD seeks to engage with the work of the contemporary creative industries and reflect the concerns of a changing society. DAD&#8217;s collecting priorities are to consider design within the context of society, to document important global shifts in the practices and processes of design and show connections between the designed world and current socio-political concerns. DAD&#8217;s collection is international, showing the global circulation of objects from production to consumption, and the impacts of globalisation on labour, how things are made and the environment. It is diverse and inclusive, reflecting multiple voices and viewpoints (of gender, age, race, class, sexuality and ability), and scales and modes of practice, from the DIY to the mass-produced.</p>
<p>DAD&#8217;s emphasis is primarily on contemporary collecting. However, where appropriate, to develop the collections, it also collects historical material. DAD shares responsibility for 20<sup>th</sup>&#8211; and 21st-century furniture and product design with Furniture, Textiles and Fashion (FTF). DAD includes the Designs section, which is responsible for the collection of design drawings and models. The Designs collection ranges from the 14th-century to the present day and includes the collection of architectural drawings and models. The Designs section is matrix-managed with WID, in whose stores the Designs collection is located.</p>
<p>DAD is the lead department for the V&amp;A+RIBA Architecture Partnership, initiated in 2001, which offers access to two world-class architectural collections via the Architecture Gallery, the Architecture Display Gallery and the Study Room. The DAD team also developed ‘Rapid Response Collecting&#8217;, an acquisition strand that is reactive to international events, and enables the collection and immediate display of objects that articulate important moments in contemporary design and manufacturing.</p>
<p>The subject areas covered by DAD are not exclusive of one another or defined by medium or geography, and DAD curators work across the wide field of design to explore relevant, contemporary issues and new practices. DAD curators collaborate with colleagues in other departments also collecting contemporary material. Digital design (as process, interface and object), for example, is central to all areas of contemporary art and design collected by the Museum. DAD, in its collecting work, therefore overlays and complements the collecting strategies of other departments.</p>
<p>In addition to collecting in accordance with the priorities outlined above, the development of DAD&#8217;s collection also seeks to collect in support of other activities in the museum, including displays and exhibitions, FuturePlan gallery projects, and V&amp;A East.</p>
<h3>A history of contemporary collecting</h3>
<p>Contemporary collecting has been at the heart of the V&amp;A&#8217;s mission since its first director Henry Cole founded the Museum in 1852 to promote economic growth in Britain through design and to showcase new products, exhibiting contemporary objects alongside historical ones. However, for the next 100 years, the museum&#8217;s resources were concentrated mainly on building up historical collections and there was no sustained museum-wide effort to make late 19<sup>th</sup>&#8211; and 20th-century collections representative (most departments had an unofficial ‘fifty-year rule&#8217; against purchasing recent objects). The exception was the Circulation Department, which operated from 1909 until closure following government cuts in 1977, which collected contemporary objects for temporary exhibitions and an extensive touring programme to regional museums, art schools, galleries and libraries.</p>
<p>In 1975, then director Sir Roy Strong allocated a special fund to all departments to collect post-1920s objects and, on the Circulation Departments demise, Keepers took an active role in ‘strengthening the museum&#8217;s representation of twentieth-century design&#8217; in preparation for a designated Twentieth Century Gallery. From 1982-1986 the V&amp;A hosted the ‘Boilerhouse&#8217; project, operated independently by the Conran Foundation, which explored current manufacturing in contemporary exhibitions, and collected contemporary objects before the project broke away (taking its collection with it) to become the Design Museum.</p>
<p>In 1989, when the Board of Trustees allocated half of the museum&#8217;s annual purchase grant to 20thcentury objects, the centrality of collecting contemporary design was reasserted in an attempt to reconnect with Henry Cole&#8217;s founding vision for the museum, as well as widen the museum&#8217;s base within the creative industries and serve a younger audience, providing inspiration for all. In 2002, a new Contemporary Team was established to present an active, innovative and inter-disciplinary programme of displays, installations, events and exhibitions, including the monthly Friday Late evenings, and in 2007 the Porter Gallery became the hub of a designated contemporary programme.</p>
<p>In 2012, the Contemporary Team was restructured and the following year a collections-based section within an expanded Furniture, Textiles and Fashion (FTF) department was established: the Contemporary Architecture, Design and Digital (CADD) section. This reorganisation sought to embed the museum&#8217;s contemporary activities even further within the collections and engage in new ways with the world of contemporary architecture, design, manufacturing and digital design. In 2015, this became the Design, Architecture and Digital Department (DAD), a collections department, with a clear mandate for the contemporary.</p>
<h3>Collecting Design</h3>
<p>Since its inception as a department in 2015, DAD has made a number of industrial and product design acquisitions ranging from lighting to mobile phones, personal computers to smart thermostats and drones. These acquisitions show important instances of mass manufacture, innovative design practices and new processes of production and consumption.</p>
<p>There are examples of mass-produced objects in many of the V&amp;A&#8217;s collections, including Ceramics and Glass, Metalwork, Furniture and Woodwork, as well as Asia. However, it has not been the remit of any department to focus on serially produced objects, particularly not object types, such as electronics and lighting, that sit outside of a purely material and geographic focus. As the consumption of our core object types and materials moved in the 20<sup>th</sup> century to mass-produced objects, and as the design professions developed objects powered by batteries, electricity and petrol, the V&amp;A&#8217;s collection lost its connection to contemporary design practice and the consumption patterns of wider society.</p>
<p>Throughout the 20th century, the majority of the V&amp;A&#8217;s industrial design objects were acquired through the Circulation Department, in particular following the Second World War when developments in manufacturing methods and the scale of production, and with that the role of the designer, altered drastically. Objects in this field include, for example, injection-moulded chairs and vacuum-formed crockery. From the late 1950s to the early 1970s, the museum also acquired examples of industrial design from the Council of Industrial Design through the gift of works by the winners of the Design Centre Award. These include washing machines, lighting, gardening tools, small electronics and products designed for the office environment. When the Circulation Department closed in 1977 these objects were dispersed across other collecting departments and the coherence of this collection was lost.</p>
<p>When the new Twentieth Century Gallery opened in 1992 the curators included types of industrial design not previously collected or displayed in a permanent gallery context, including stereo equipment and household appliances. However, the focus waned once the gallery project was completed and therefore the collection is patchy and does not reflect changes in manufacturing and consumption of the last 30 years.</p>
<h3>Collecting Architecture</h3>
<p>In 2001, the V&amp;A entered into a collaboration with the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) known as the V&amp;A+RIBA Architecture Partnership. The Architecture Partnership provides public access through the Study Rooms, the Architecture Gallery and the Architecture Display Gallery to two world-class collections. The bulk of the RIBA&#8217;s drawings are stored at South Kensington, though they remain a separate collection from the V&amp;A&#8217;s collection and are looked after by the RIBA&#8217;s team of curators and conservators. The RIBA&#8217;s architectural archives, photographs and books are stored and accessed at Portland Place and at an off-site storage centre.</p>
<p>In 2015, with the creation of DAD, responsibility for the V&amp;A+RIBA Architecture Partnership (and therefore for the management of the shared spaces of the Architecture Gallery and Architecture Display Gallery) was transferred to the department. The museum restated its commitment to its architectural collections, and introduced a new emphasis on urbanism and interest in the role architecture plays in shaping society. The Designs section was moved from the Word and Image Department to DAD, though the collection – which includes the collection of architectural drawings, which is one of the designated national collections – is housed in the WID stores and continues to be matrix-managed with WID.</p>
<p>DAD curators liaise closely with the RIBA as part of the V&amp;A+RIBA Architecture Partnership to ensure that collecting by either party does not infringe on the remit of the other institution, and to ensure that potential donations or purchases find the most appropriate home. Architectural archives have traditionally been collected by the RIBA rather than the V&amp;A, except in some cases where the individual&#8217;s practice has also extended to other areas of design, or where the archive has not fallen within the RIBA&#8217;s collecting remit. In some exceptional cases, and in consultation with the RIBA, the V&amp;A has collected specific architectural archives. It is expected that the acquisition of architectural archives will remain an exceptional occurrence.</p>
<p>Architecture has been collected from the earliest days of the Museum in the form of architectural drawings, models, photographs, plaster casts and original building fragments. A number of the Museum&#8217;s architectural holdings derive from the collection of the Architectural Museum, founded in 1851, which was intended to be the ‘National Museum of Architecture&#8217;. It was resident at the South Kensington Museum from when the latter opened in 1857 until 1869, where its casts, photographs and original fragments complimented the South Kensington Museum&#8217;s collection of ‘Construction and Building Materials&#8217;.</p>
<p>In 1869, the Architecture Museum (renamed the Royal Architectural Museum) moved to separate premises, but when it closed permanently in 1916, the bulk of its collection of casts and original fragments was given to the V&amp;A, where the items were dispersed into the various departments. Architectural collections at the V&amp;A have always been held across the departments, depending on their material (e.g. plaster models in Sculpture; wooden models in Furniture; ironwork in Metalwork; drawings and mixed-media models in Word and Image). Architecture is still collected across other departments in the museum as well as DAD (for example, architectural fragments in FTF and SMCG; posters in WID; designs for theatres in T&amp;P; models in Asia) and the Architecture section therefore liaises closely with those departments as appropriate.</p>
<h3>Collecting Digital Design</h3>
<p>Since its establishment in 2015, digital design has been part of the collecting remit of DAD. In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, it is vital to collect digital design to understand its impact on design and society today, in the recent past and into the future. Digital design consists of but is not limited to: product design, software and physical computing; systems and industrial design; web design and social media; interaction, interface and information design; videogames and communications design; new media and computer programming. Digital design works across both the physical and digital domain, and intersects with other forms of design, for example, architecture, textiles and ceramics, furniture and fashion, among others.</p>
<p>The presence of networked technologies, such as computers, smartphones and the internet, has transformed the ways in which design is produced, applied and disseminated. The rise of design that is born digitally or mediated through digital means has had a significant impact on public life and culture, and DAD seeks to acquire objects that reflect this.</p>
<p>Digital design works between the physical (computer terminals, personal devices such as the iPhone) and the abstract (the internet, data, digital media, software and applications). DAD&#8217;s digital design collection will work to make the intangible and immaterial (that which we cannot immediately touch or see) tangible through objects that show evidence of, or make present, the existence of a digitally enabled and mediated world. This may be through collecting the work of artists and speculative designers that surface challenges around digital design or collecting user-generated design.</p>
<p>The museum has a long history of engaging with and collecting digital design. Digital work is also collected by the digital art section in WID, and hardware, electronic devices and computing are also collected by the Furniture and Woodwork section in FTF, and Metalwork section in SMCG, and the Asia Department. The Museum of Childhood has also collected a small number of digital objects, including games consoles and videogames. From the early 2000s, WID have collected the work of digital art practitioners, documenting computer-generated design and art from the 1950s onwards. Holdings include works on paper, books, catalogues, archival material and ephemera, as well as a growing number of born-digital works. The acquisition of the Computer Arts Society Collection and the Patric Prince collections brought national significance to the V&amp;A&#8217;s holdings of digital art.</p>
<p>As designers increasingly work with digital tools, digital collecting is important for all departments and sections within the museum. For example, the collection of tools such as AutoDesk&#8217;s ‘AutoCAD&#8217; computer aided design software will enable our Designs and Architecture collections to be better contextualized within contemporary digital practice.</p>
<h3>Rapid Response Collecting</h3>
<p>In 2014, Rapid Response Collecting was launched by the Contemporary Architecture, Design and Digital (CADD) section as a new acquisitions activity, and since 2015 has been the responsibility of DAD. It is a reactive mode of collecting that enables the acquisition and immediate display of designed things that articulate important moments in the recent history of design and manufacturing.</p>
<p>Rapid Response acquisitions are brought into the museum at the time when they are the subject of public and/or critical discussion. Standing as evidence of social, political, technological and economic change, these objects expand the definition of design and further public understanding of the role it plays in contemporary society. Acquisitions to date include a 3D-printed firearm which changed public understanding of distributed manufacturing, a smart thermostat designed to learn behaviours and automatically regulate heating consumption in the home, a 2016 Vote Leave campaign leaflet which used the National Health Service graphic identity as a means to convey political messages, a mosquito emoji created as part of a public health campaign, and a pair of camera-enabled sunglasses that mark a step toward ubiquitous computing.</p>
<p>All new acquisitions are put on immediate display and the reasons why an object has been collected at a given moment in time are clearly articulated. Colleagues from across the museum and members of the public are encouraged to suggest objects for acquisition and this invitation serves as a means to bring in new and diverse forms of expertise. In operating at all times in public, Rapid Response Collecting seeks to foster discussion about what the museum should collect, and the role it can play in helping navigate the realities of the digital age. Although at times of modest material value, Rapid Response Collecting objects are important and often newsworthy acquisitions, either because they advance what design can do or because they reveal how we live together today and how we might live tomorrow.</p>
<h2>FURNITURE, TEXTILES &amp; FASHION DEPARTMENT</h2>
<h3>History and collections</h3>
<p>The Furniture, Textiles and Fashion Department was formed in 2001. It amalgamated the two former departments of Furniture and Woodwork and Textiles and Dress, underlining the connections between these materials and media, synergies behind past and present collecting, and future ambitions for closer collaboration.</p>
<p>Objects from Western Europe dominate all these collections, with small holdings from other parts of the world (except Asia). The Furniture and Woodwork collection comprises furniture from the medieval period to current times, alongside architectural woodwork and plasterwork, musical instruments and smaller items in wood and leather. It is unmatched in its breadth and quality and one of the largest collections of historic furniture in the world. The Textile collection is the world&#8217;s largest of its kind, chronologically and geographically wide-ranging, with textiles dating mainly from the 3<sup>rd</sup> century CE to the present day. The Fashion collection is the premier collection in the UK, consisting of fashionable clothes and accessories from the last five hundred years.</p>
<h4>Scope and collecting</h4>
<p>The Department holds more than 84,000 objects. We continue the long-established tradition of collecting both historical and contemporary objects, focussing mainly on high-style design, manufacture or craftsmanship and seeking objects that tell intriguing stories not only about design processes, cutting edge technology and designers and makers, but also about those who commissioned, owned or used them. New Museum projects, including gallery renovations and temporary exhibitions, regularly provide opportunities to make complementary acquisitions that enhance our story of art and design and its interpretation for our visitors. In recent years, the V&amp;A website has facilitated fuller interaction with wider and distant audiences, disseminating V&amp;A expertise in and information about the collections and special exhibitions, as well as eliciting responses, knowledge and offers of acquisitions from our audiences.</p>
<p>Like other V&amp;A curatorial departments, we acquire through donation as well as purchase. Our focus overall is on exceptionally fine, objects with a clear provenance and those that otherwise illuminate design of their period. While we generally collect objects, which lead rather than follow taste, the changing nature of design and consumption since the Victorian era, and especially in the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries, has meant that our collecting in more recent decades covers a wider range of society.</p>
<h3>Furniture and Woodwork</h3>
<p>The Furniture and Woodwork collection is one of the largest collections of historic Western furniture in the world and is unmatched in breadth and quality. It has traditionally been referred to as the National Collection of furniture. Unlike most major European furniture collections, it does not have its origins in a former royal collection. While the UK is fortunate to have many institutions with fine collections of furniture, most of these—many of which are now Arts Council Designated Collections—are much smaller and narrower in scope.</p>
<h4>Scope</h4>
<p>The geographical and chronological range of the Furniture and Woodwork collection is unique. Its greatest strengths lie in the holdings of British furniture made between 1700 and 1900: Georgian, Regency, Gothic Revival, Aesthetic, and Arts and Crafts furniture. Other areas in which the collection is internationally strong are French 16<sup>th</sup>-century woodwork, late medieval moulded leather, gilt leather panels, Western European musical instruments from the Renaissance to the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, French 18<sup>th</sup>-century case furniture, International Exhibition furniture and Art Nouveau furniture from the Paris World&#8217;s Fair of 1900 (Donaldson Collection). In certain areas, such as 18th-century furniture from the German states or 15thcentury Italian furniture, we have examples which are outstanding though relatively few in number. Our international 20th-century holdings as a group are rivalled by perhaps only one other institution (the Vitra Design Museum), and are notably rich in areas such as the Omega Workshops, the Wiener Werkstätte and Modernist furniture by leading designers such as Eileen Gray and Marcel Breuer, and also includes icons of popular culture such as Salvador Dalí and Edward James&#8217;s <em>Mae West Lips</em> sofa.</p>
<p>The Furniture and Woodwork collection contains more than 11,000 objects, dating from the medieval period to the present day, with a small quantity of late Roman, archaeological woodwork. Most are from western Europe or have strong connections to Western cultures, including those shaped by patterns of colonialism and global trade. The department&#8217;s collection of woodwork produced in Islamic centres was transferred to the Asian Department in 2018. Although moveable furniture forms the core of the collection, there are also substantial holdings of interior architectural woodwork and plasterwork. We have also collected musical instruments, leatherwork and smaller decorative items in wood and papiermâché. With such an extensive collection, considerations of space are always important, so certain large furniture types such as beds, library bookcases, office desks or extensive sets of furniture tend to be represented by relatively few examples. The collecting of clocks is shared with the Metalwork collection according to case materials, reflecting the V&amp;A&#8217;s interest in aesthetic rather than technical design (which is the province of the British Museum).</p>
<p>During more than 160 years our collecting has encompassed many and varied approaches to design history but the landmark opening of the Dr Susan Weber Furniture Gallery in 2012 powerfully reinforced the special attention we give to the ways in which furniture has been made and decorated. It serves as a primary platform for the deeper understanding of furniture-making in the West and is backed up by extensive online resources representing many aspects of the collection.</p>
<h4>National Role</h4>
<p>The Furniture and Woodwork Collection forms part of the wider national collection held in museums, historic houses, churches and public buildings throughout the UK. We are particularly proud of our programme of long-term loans to dozens of venues around the UK, involving hundreds of pieces of furniture. Here they are seen, studied and enjoyed in contexts very different to the museum&#8217;s galleries, and by visitors with different interests and motivations. We maintain strong, collaborative relationships with regional museums and other heritage organisations such as Historic England and The National Trust. The V&amp;A has always encouraged and responded to the strategic collecting of furniture by other public institutions. Over many decades this has enriched a constellation of mutually complementary collections such as those held by the Wallace Collection, Temple Newsam House, Leeds, the Lady Lever Art Gallery (National Museums Liverpool), the Burrell Collection, Glasgow and the Bowes Museum, Barnard Castle. Our activities have also responded to the pressure on regional museums which has caused them to adopt ever more selective collecting policies. Whereas some institutions, such as The Wilson, Cheltenham (for Cotswold furniture and, more widely, the Arts and Crafts movement), and the Judges&#8217; Lodgings, Lancaster (for pieces by Gillows), acquire objects representing the history of their own local craft or industry, many other areas and aspects of production have become neglected. As a result of this we have taken a particularly active role in many different areas to ensure that the V&amp;A collection is as representative as possible of high design from all major centres.</p>
<p>In the past, some items have been acquired with the specific intention of returning them on loan or by transfer to other institutions. In the case of furniture, examples include the Mary of Modena bed, transferred to Historic Royal Palaces, a state bed from Boughton House given by the Duke of Buccleuch in 1916, and now returned on loan, and the giltwood table designed by John Vardy, now shown in Spencer House, London, together with the suite of chairs designed by him for the Painted Room. With the creation of the British Galleries in 2001 came a long-awaited chance to loan, and subsequently transfer to Sizergh Castle, Cumbria (National Trust) the 16th-century panelling and bed sold from the house in the 1890s. The allocation to the V&amp;A of furniture under the Acceptance in Lieu scheme has brought outstanding furnishings at Longleat, Houghton Hall and Harewood House into the collection in recent decades, ensuring their preservation for the nation while remaining <em>in situ</em>.</p>
<h4>History of collecting furniture and woodwork</h4>
<p>Although Western furniture is now seen as the core of the Furniture and Woodwork collection, it originated (as did most collections in the museum) in the purchase of fine examples of woodworking techniques/craftsmanship for the Government Schools of Design at Somerset House in the 1840s. The earliest acquisitions, of contemporary French parquetry and carving from the Paris Exhibition of 1844, were typical of the kind of material acquired in the first twenty years of the museum&#8217;s life. Though historical pieces were acquired from 1848 onwards, the emphasis for acquisitions of all dates was on technical excellence and the value of such pieces as examples for current practitioners. Purchases included European and Asian woodwork of all kinds, with lacquer and carving particularly strongly represented. It was the Great Exhibition of 1851 that prompted the acquisition of contemporary furniture, both British and from continental Europe, but again, technical virtuosity was the prime criterion for selection.</p>
<p>A powerful tool in the development of the Furniture and Woodwork collection in the 19<sup>th</sup> century was the acquisition of complete personal collections. Amongst the largest of these were the Soulages Collection of Italian and French Renaissance objects (acquired between 1859 and 1865) and the Jones Collection of predominantly 18th-century fine and decorative arts (bequeathed in 1882). Such additions continued in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, including the Bettine, Lady Abingdon Collection of twenty-four pieces or pairs of French Empire furniture, bequeathed by Mrs T.R.P. Hole in 1986.</p>
<p>From the 1880s onwards, the preference for highly decorated continental furniture and woodwork gradually gave way to a developing taste for English furniture made before the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>At the same time, the interest in contemporary furniture waned, as the fashion for antique collecting gripped the middle classes. From this time, for more than a generation, the museum concentrated on acquiring British furniture of the 16<sup>th</sup> to the 18<sup>th</sup> centuries. It was in this period (1890–1930) that the Museum acquired many of its period rooms, which became a fundamental and very popular aspect of the displays. Currently, twelve examples are on exhibition, whole or in part (nine in the British Galleries and three in Europe 1600-1800), and with a conscious variety of methods of presentation which acknowledge varying levels of completeness. The creation of V&amp;A East provides opportunities for the redisplay of others. As a result of the greater protection for historic interiors in recent decades and the large amount of space that complete interiors require, period rooms are acquired very rarely, as with Frank Lloyd Wright&#8217;s Kaufmann office, acquired by gift in 1974, and the Frankfurt Kitchen designed by Margarete SchütteLihotzky, acquired in 2005 for display in an exhibition.</p>
<p>Contemporary collecting, which had formed such an important aspect of the museum&#8217;s acquisition policy in its early years, was almost entirely abandoned in 1909. The long series of acquisitions from international exhibitions in the 19<sup>th</sup> century had culminated in the presentation by Sir George Donaldson of a collection of Art Nouveau furniture that had been shown at the 1900 Exhibition in Paris. Such was the public criticism this generated that contemporary furniture collecting was not resumed systematically until the 1960s, although some pieces had been courageously collected by the Circulation Department during the 1920s and 1930s. These were distributed to the appropriate material-based departments, including Furniture and Woodwork, when the Circulation Department was disbanded in 1977. Since the late 1980s the collecting of contemporary furniture has been re-established as a high priority, and since 2015 this has been carried out in co-operation with the Design, Architecture and Digital Department.</p>
<h3>Textiles</h3>
<p>The Textile collection is designated as the National Collection. Like the Furniture and Woodwork collection, it differs from many fine and well-established national collections in Europe in terms of its international coverage over a long historical period. Its designation as a National Collection is taken as representing a support role for the many smaller collections of textiles held by museums throughout Britain. In recent year, few regional museums, other than the Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester, have been able to maintain and develop collections of textiles with a wide scope, leaving the V&amp;A with the responsibility for maintaining the breadth of the nation&#8217;s collections.</p>
<h4>Scope</h4>
<p>The Textiles collection is the world&#8217;s largest and most wide-ranging of its kind. Many of its sections are remarkable for their variety and comprehensiveness. It includes examples from every continent except Asia and Antarctica, the majority from Western Europe. Most of the collection extends in date from the 3<sup>rd</sup> century CE to the present day, while a small number of archaeological textiles dates as far back as ancient Egypt. The collection of British textiles is the finest in the world and includes the widest possible range of objects, from samples from manufacturers&#8217; or salesmen&#8217;s books through small, exquisite items of dress or personal adornment to large furnishings.</p>
<h4>History of collecting textiles</h4>
<p>The Museum&#8217;s Textile collection began with the formation of study collections for the Government Schools of Design in 1842. These focussed on materials and techniques (animal and plant fibres) and decorative methods (woven, embroidered, printed and lace). As that collection grew, there was a revival of interest in historical patterns and in their potential for adaptation. When the Museum was founded in 1852, medieval and renaissance textiles were acquired, many of which had survived in the form of church vestments. There was also sustained interest in the manufacture of lace, with attempts at reviving the lace industries in several countries in the middle of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. The Museum responded by acquiring and exhibiting many fine examples. It also acquired contemporary woven and printed textiles from the Great Exhibition of 1851 and the Paris Exhibitions of 1855 and 1867. The Museum&#8217;s initial emphasis, however, had been on the acquisition of pre-19<sup>th</sup>-century material, partly because contemporary textiles did not conform to the principles of ‘good design&#8217; then championed by museum curators and design reformers. The Museum showed little interest in contemporary embroidery, probably reflecting its original concern with the manufacturing industries rather than with craft production.</p>
<p>During the 19<sup>th</sup> century the Museum made individual purchases, received gifts and bequests. It also acquired many large collections of historical textiles, including 500 medieval and renaissance textiles from the Bock collection in 1863, and 450 16<sup>th–</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup>-century European textiles from the Forrer collection in 1877.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century to the 1930s, the Museum collected textiles from the period 1600 to 1750. English domestic embroidery from the 17<sup>th</sup> century is well represented and includes large furnishing fabrics as well as small items of dress. The collection of 17<sup>th</sup>–century European textiles is large and extraordinarily varied, while the 700 18<sup>th</sup>-century, Greek and Turkish embroideries from the Dawkins collection, purchased in 1950, is unrivalled in scale and quality in Europe. In 1931 the Museum received as a bequest Alfred Maudslay&#8217;s 19<sup>th</sup>-century Guatemalan and Mexican textiles, collected in the 1890s.</p>
<p>More recently, in the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the Museum benefited from re-organization within the British textile industry, acquiring major collections of 18<sup>th–</sup>, 19<sup>th–</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup>-century textiles from leading UK manufacturers. They include 1,215 textiles and pattern books from Warners in 1972 and, subsequently 87 textiles from Mortons/Courtaulds in 1977, 73 textiles from Hull Traders in 1989, 157 samples from The Wilton Royal Carpet Factory in 1992, about 1,150 lengths of furnishing fabrics from Heals in 1999, and an archive of over 6,000 items covering a wide range of manufacturers and dates from Courtaulds in 2001.</p>
<p>Collecting contemporary textiles, which had an erratic early history, was almost entirely abandoned in 1909 when it became the responsibility of the Circulation Department. In 1977 the Textiles department inherited the Circulation Department&#8217;s textile collection and once again resumed contemporary collecting. In 1934 the Museum had acquired the collections of the British Institute of Industrial Art, which had collected contemporary textiles on an annual basis from 1919 to 1932. It undertook to continue the tradition by collecting those textiles which were judged to be the best of each year&#8217;s international production. In this way an extensive and unique collection of 20<sup>th</sup>-century textiles of both industrial and craft production grew to complement the historical collection. In 1979 and 2002 many fabric samples previously held in the Manchester Design Registry were acquired to enhance the collection of early 20<sup>th</sup>-century textiles. The Textile collection is the world&#8217;s largest and most wide-ranging assemblage of such material.</p>
<p>In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, we have continued to add to the collection of historical textiles when exceptional items come on the market, often unexpectedly and in connection with exhibitions or the presence of an artist-in-residence.</p>
<h3>Fashion</h3>
<p>The Fashion collection is designated the National Collection and is one of the largest in the world, rivalled only by the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum in New York, the Musée de la Mode et du Textile, the Musée Galliera in Paris, MOMU in Antwerp and the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan. Its holdings consist mainly of European fashionable dress and accessories from the last 500 years. It has grown considerably in importance since the 1970s, attracting both scholarly interest and remaining one of the V&amp;A&#8217;s most popular collections with general visitors. The material dating from 1600 to 1800 is the largest collection in the world, while the collection of 20<sup>th</sup>-century sub-cultural fashion is unique in range and size.</p>
<h4>Scope</h4>
<p>The Fashion collection spans five centuries, its strengths lying in the period from the 18<sup>th</sup> century onwards, with some rare pieces dating from the 17<sup>th</sup> century. Contemporary holdings include American and Japanese fashion. Like the Textile collection, the Fashion collection has groups of objects that are important for their depth of coverage, such as 18<sup>th</sup>-century men&#8217;s waistcoats, 1930s evening wear, postwar couture, 1960s daywear, fashion dolls, shawls and wedding dresses. It includes many outstanding items, with an emphasis on women&#8217;s dress and formal dress, including two magnificent court mantuas from the 1740s, evening gowns by Worth, a Charles James padded satin jacket of 1937, the seminal New Look suit ‘Bar&#8217; by Christian Dior, and Vivienne Westwood&#8217;s ‘mock-croc&#8217; blue platform shoes. Twenty-first century fashion acquisitions include the work of Giles Deacon, Mary Katrantzou, Nicholas Kirkwood, Alexander McQueen and Dries Van Noten.</p>
<h4>History of collecting dress</h4>
<p>The history of dress did not figure in the hierarchy of arts when the Museum was founded. Garments were nonetheless acquired as early as the 1840s but only if the textile were considered significant. Gradually this approach changed and clothing was acquired for other reasons, such as its fashionable cut and construction, provenance, rarity and the aesthetic appeal of the garment design. The collecting developed slowly and sporadically, chiefly through gifts, purchases or bequests of individual objects. Occasionally items came as part of collections of historical fashion, including accessories. These collections included 30 items of fashion and about 200 textiles from the Brooke Collection in 1864 and 1865, 124 fans from Sir Matthew and Lady Digby Wyatt in 1876, 31 items of dress and textiles from the Isham Collection in 1900, and 1442 items of dress from the Harrods collection in 1913. Items of contemporary fashion began arriving in the 1930s.</p>
<p>By the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century the discipline of dress studies was firmly established and in 1957 the first curator of fashion was appointed. Active collecting of 20<sup>th</sup>-century fashion began in earnest in the 1960s. Several major holdings enhanced the collections: the Board of Trade Utility Collection of 34 items in 1942-3, the Heather Firbank Collection of 110 items of dress in 1960, the Cecil Beaton Collection of 12,000 items of dress in 1971, the Street Style collection from the exhibition of that name of 1,253 items of dress between 1993-1995, the Jill Rittblat Collection of 459 items of dress in 2000, the Costiff Collection of 178 full outfits by Vivienne Westwood in 2002, and, most recently, the Mark Reed collection of menswear of more than 50 complete ensembles, the Rayne Archive in 2017, and in 2018 30 items by Mary Quant.</p>
<h2>MUSEUM OF CHILDHOOD</h2>
<h3>History of the Collection</h3>
<p>The Bethnal Green Branch of the South Kensington Museum opened to the public in June 1872. It was devised as an inspirational resource for local people, and to be an attractor to the neighbourhood for more affluent Londoners. For the first century of its existence, the Bethnal Green Museum (BGM) did not have a particularly clear sphere of activity. Its original exhibits were a collection of animal and food products, the former of which still composes a discrete part of MoC&#8217;s collection. In 1880, it received a large transfer of near-contemporary decorative art objects from South Kensington, however BGM did not retain its own collection at that time. In its first decades, the museum played host to a variety of others, such as the collections of Sir Richard Wallace and Augustus Pitt Rivers, and to what would later become the National Portrait Gallery, as well as objects relating to traditional East End trades such as shoe-making and silk weaving.</p>
<p>A key figure in the history of collecting at BGM, and in the formation of its later identity, was Arthur Sabin. He had been appointed its curator in 1922 with a task to reorganise the museum, and was the first curator to collect objects specifically for BGM. He is remembered especially for his work with children, and his careful observations of how they used a museum. As well as collecting toys and other childhood-related objects, he hung paintings at a low height, created a formal education programme and established meaningful relationships with the local community. In the early years of the collection major donors included Mary Greg, an important collector of everyday domestic objects, Edward Lovett and Queen Mary.</p>
<p>In 1974, Sir Roy Strong reimagined BGM as a museum of childhood, creating a home for the V&amp;A&#8217;s collection of childhood objects. The small existing childhood collections were soon supplemented by major transfers of material from the V&amp;A South Kensington&#8217;s collecting departments. The MoC&#8217;s collecting strategy has subsequently formed part of the overall policy of the V&amp;A. Major collections acquired in this period have included a large and varied gift from the Palitoy Company (acquired in phases 1991-1999); Donne Buck&#8217;s archive of material relating to adventure playgrounds (acquired 2014-2017); and prototypes by Fredun Shapur (acquired 2015).</p>
<p>In 2017, a major capital redevelopment of the MoC was announced to coincide with its 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary in 2022. The emphasis of the museum is to change from a broad focus on the history and material culture of childhood, to a design-led museum for children, young people, and their carers. Its collecting strategy for the period 2019-2024 is formulated to reflect the new vision.</p>
<h3>Overview of the current collections</h3>
<p>The MoC, as a museum in its own right, has a collection that is varied, complex and broad. The collection can be viewed as being in two major parts: childhood objects acquired before 1974 transferred from the V&amp;A&#8217;s other collecting departments; and objects collected directly by the MoC. Both parts are composed of broadly similar object types and materials, but with a far larger number of toys and games collected since 1974. Many areas crossover superficially with other V&amp;A collections in terms of object types, such as furniture, photographs and ceramics, but with a specific concentration on children. A historic lack of clarity over MoC&#8217;s collecting remit has meant that acquisitions have not always been made strategically, and have tended to reflect a more social historical outlook than the applied arts, performance and design collections of the V&amp;A. The collection is international in breadth but is best described as British-European in focus. The five main areas of collecting between 1974 and 2018 have been:</p>
<ul>
<li>Children&#8217;s Clothing (daywear, nightwear, workwear, formal clothing, fancy dress and play)</li>
<li>Dolls&#8217; Houses and Miniatures (including models)</li>
<li>Children&#8217;s Narratives (includes furniture, feeding equipment, child-made objects, learning and school-related objects, puppets, optical toys, video games)</li>
<li>Play (includes dolls, games and puzzles, learning and development, soft toys and toys)</li>
<li>Visual Representations of Childhood (includes art, paintings, photographs)</li>
<li>Archive (toy making, childhood papers)</li>
</ul>
<p>MoC&#8217;s singular strengths are its internationally important collections of dolls&#8217; houses, children&#8217;s clothing and dolls. The sub-collection of fancy dress is uniquely rich and significant. The board games collection is very good, particularly strong for the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries, but with greater variation in quality in its 20<sup>th</sup> century holdings. The children&#8217;s furniture collection is the best in the UK and consists of around 100 pieces and is especially strong in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Toys make-up a large portion of the collection, although the overall quality of the toy holdings is variable.</p>
<p>Areas in which the MoC has aimed to collect, but in which it is currently less strong, include video games and digital objects, design relating to toys and schools, and contemporary material of all types. Design material is strong in specific areas – such as the Palitoy collection – but is not very well-represented across time periods and object types.</p>
<h3>Archival holdings</h3>
<p>The MoC archives relate to varied areas of interest including industrial history, with reference to British toy manufacturing, the social history of education and child development, theories of play and toy design. Most of the material is 20<sup>th</sup> century. Important collections include the British Toymaking Archive (photographic material, trade catalogues, advertisements and promotional documents, press cuttings, financial records, company and personal correspondence and designs); the Faith Eaton archive (history of dolls and dolls&#8217; houses); and the Donne Buck archive (play and playgrounds). The archive also contains historical records of the Museum of Childhood, including catalogues and other registers, photographic material, records of past exhibitions and displays and material relating to the history of the building.</p>
<h2>SCULPTURE, METALWORK, CERAMICS &amp; GLASS</h2>
<h3>Sculpture</h3>
<p>The Sculpture collection is the most comprehensive holding of post-classical European sculpture in the world, containing over 17,000 objects. Since it was formed within an applied art museum, the V&amp;A&#8217;s collection is much broader than those found in many art galleries, where sculpture often simply forms an adjunct to a paintings collection. The collection contains outstanding and numerous examples of medieval ivories and English medieval alabasters, and celebrated collections of Italian Renaissance and Baroque sculpture; it also extends to polychrome wood sculpture and small-scale boxwood statuettes, terracotta sculptors&#8217; models, bronze statuettes and functional pieces, including ivory plaques for the adornment of book covers. The chronological range of the collection is conditioned by the existence of the pre-eminent collections of classical sculpture at the British Museum and the holdings of post-1914 sculptures at Tate. With a small number of exceptions, therefore, the earliest pieces date from the beginnings of Christian art in around 300 AD and the latest to the early 20th century.</p>
<p>The collection enjoys the status of a National Collection. Although certain categories of European postclassical sculpture are also to be found in the British Museum, the Wallace Collection and notable regional museums, nowhere else in the UK is the entire range of sculpture represented in such depth. The earliest acquisition dates from 1844. Major landmarks in the second half of the 19th century included the acquisition of the Gherardini Collection of sculptors&#8217; models in 1854, sculpture from the Soulages Collection in 1856 and the Gigli-Campana Collection of Italian Sculpture in 1861. Numerous acquisitions made by J C Robinson in 1852-67 and the early 1880s created a collection of Italian sculpture that is unequalled outside Italy. The extensive collection of medieval ivories was established by the end of the 1860s through a series of purchases from the London dealer John Webb. The beginning of the 20th century was marked by gifts of Romanesque and Gothic sculpture from J H Fitzhenry between 1906 and 1910, and the Salting Bequest greatly strengthened the holding of bronzes and ivories in 1910. Rodin&#8217;s gift of 18 of his sculptures in 1914 instantly established the Museum as a place of study for the artist&#8217;s work. In 1916 the collection of architectural sculptures and plaster casts from the Royal Architectural Museum was transferred to the V&amp;A. Dr W L Hildburgh was an outstanding benefactor to both the Sculpture and Metalwork collections: from 1915 until his death in 1955 he made numerous single gifts, but his greatest donation was his entire collection of over 260 English Medieval alabasters, given on his 70th birthday in 1946.</p>
<p>We aim to acquire documented, signed and dated works of art that will enrich the most comprehensive holding of post-classical sculpture in the world. In recent years major acquisitions have included Lorenzo Bartolini&#8217;s <em>Campbell Sisters</em> (co-owned with the National Galleries of Scotland) and the <em>Wolsey Angels</em>. In addition, we have made strategic and serendipitous acquisitions of modern sculpture (such as Leon Underwood&#8217;s <em>Gladiators</em>), with an increasing interest in objects that hold relevance across the department (the ceramic <em>Bust of Enoch Wood</em>). In the next five years, we will continue to pursue such opportunities for enhancing our historic collections in British sculpture, alongside other regions of Europe that are less well represented, notably in the period post-1800. An agreement reached with Tate in 1983 stipulated that the V&amp;A would not collect large-scale sculpture produced after 1914. In 2018 a second agreement was reached with Tate which opened up the possibility to expand our British and international holdings in sculpture for the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, especially in areas that fall within the V&amp;A&#8217;s design and decorative art focus, including works on a larger scale. This area of development will be a focus going forward.</p>
<h3>Metalwork Section</h3>
<p>The Metalwork collection contains over 45,000 examples of decorative metalwork, silver and jewellery ranging in date from the Bronze Age to the present day. It includes an unrivalled collection of English silver, an outstandingly comprehensive collection of jewellery, and internationally significant collections of ironwork, continental silver, arms and armour, medieval champlevé and late 19th-century enamels, brass and bronze work, pewter, steel, cutlery, ormolu, Sheffield Plate, electrotypes and medieval metalwork of international importance. The pre-1800 German silver collection is the largest outside Germany and Russia. Long-term loans of British ecclesiastical silver have been encouraged since 1916 in order to illustrate this important aspect of the history of the craft.</p>
<p>European silver, non-precious metals and decorated arms and armour were actively collected from the start, and outstanding purchases of both medieval and post-medieval objects were made at the sales of great collections, including those of Bernal, Soulages and Soltikoff (the Gloucester Candlestick and the Cologne Tabernacle). J C Robinson collected important examples of Spanish ecclesiastical silver in the second half of the 19th century and a rare group of medieval silver from the Basel Cathedral Treasury, sold by auction in 1836, was later bought by the Museum. The generosity of Dr W. L. Hildburgh in the 20<sup>th</sup> century brought many pieces of European silver into the collection, including the Aldobrandini Tazza, a monstrance by Johannes Zeckl and many more examples of 16<sup>th–</sup> century Spanish and Portuguese ecclesiastical plate. More recently, individual acquisitions of pre-eminence have included the Becket Casket (1997), a reliquary of St Sebastian (2001) and a Lille ewer and basin (2007).</p>
<p>Much of the late 17th and 18thcentury British domestic silver and pewter entered the museum after 1900 as gifts and bequests from collectors; these include the Croft Lyons Collection of Sheffield Plate, pewter and boxes, the Cropper Collection of bottle tickets, and Late Stuart and Early Georgian silver from C D Rotch. In addition to its generous refurbishment of the Silver and Sacred Silver and Stained-Glass galleries, the Whiteley family has also played a major role in acquisitions of British silver over the last 25 years.</p>
<p>The collections of jewellery and small work extend from tiaras to tie-pins, and gold watches to pomanders (ca. 14,000 items). Purchases in the 19th century included contemporary French jewellery bought in exhibitions in London and Paris, the Castellani Collection of Italian regional jewellery (1868) and the ring collection of the antiquary Edmund Waterton (1870). A superb collection of gemstones, including gems from the Hope Collection, was bequeathed in 1868 by the Reverend Chauncey Hare Townshend. Over 600 jewels were given by the scholar and collector Dame Joan Evans between 1933 and 1975. They date largely from before 1800, and complement the magnificent jewellery, mainly of the late 18th and 19th centuries, bequeathed by Lady Cory in 1951. Since the 1970s, 20th -century and contemporary jewellery has been at the centre of acquisition policy, building on the foundations laid by the Circulation Department. Two outstanding collections given by Patricia V. Goldstein in 2002 and Judith H. Siegel in 2007 to the American Friends of the V&amp;A greatly increased both the quality and the extent of the display of 19<sup>th</sup>– and 20<sup>th</sup>– century European and American jewellery. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, comprising work made between 1987 and 2006, was also acquired in 2007. As with the silver collections, continual encouragement of heirs to use the benefits of the Acceptance in Lieu system has resulted in major acquisitions, including two Cartier tiaras, work by C. R. Ashbee and Henry Wilson, and jewellery from the 1960s and 1970s. Since 2008 the William and Judith Bollinger Jewellery Gallery has provided an added stimulus to donors of both contemporary and historical work. Dr Genevieve Davies and William and Judith Bollinger funded the acquisition of a set of peridots given to Miss Cotes by the Prince Regent, and the Louise Klapisch collection of contemporary jewellery was donated by Suzanne Selvi in 2014. In 2016-17 Nicholas Snowman made a major Cultural Gift of work by Neuber and Fabergé. Queen Victoria&#8217;s sapphire and diamond coronet was presented in 2017 by the family of William and Judith Bollinger. In the same year Kashmira Bulsara announced the promised gift of 49 vanity cases from the first four decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century in memory of her brother, Freddie Mercury.</p>
<h3>Ceramics and Glass</h3>
<p>The Ceramics &amp; Glass collection contains c. 80,000 objects, including ceramics and glass from the Western world, stained glass, post-medieval painted enamels on copper, and plastics. The holdings of European tin-glazed pottery and porcelain, English ceramics 1600-1900, post-medieval glass, tiles, stained glass and 20th-century and contemporary international ceramics and glass are of such size and importance as to be internationally pre-eminent. The Ceramics collection alone is without parallel; by virtue of its size, quality and range it may be considered pre-eminent in its entirety. The Glass collection, now largely housed in the Glass Gallery, is the most comprehensive in Europe, and the stained glass holdings are unparalleled anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>From 1844, the earliest acquisitions focused on contemporary work and Renaissance wares with a ‘fine art&#8217; emphasis. The French porcelain collections were strengthened by the Jones Bequest in 1882. The Schreiber Gift in 1884 laid the foundations for the outstanding collections of 18th-century English porcelain, bolstered by the transfer of objects from the Museum of Practical Geology in 1901. Maiolica and Renaissance and later painted Limoges enamels were strengthened by the Salting Bequest in 1910. The gift of the Wilfred Buckley Collection in 1936 transformed the holding of glass into one of leading international importance. The collections of stained glass, particularly of Medieval and Renaissance pieces, were augmented by the gifts and bequest (1900) of Henry Vaughan, followed by the Morgan Gift in 1919 and the gift of the Ashridge stained glass by E E Cook in 1928. Contemporary collecting by the former Circulation Department provided the foundations of today&#8217;s significant collection of 20<sup>th</sup>–century ceramics and glass. Especially rich in Scandinavian ceramics and glass, and British and European studio ceramics, this has subsequently been developed and extended into the 21st century, and the section continues to have extremely strong holdings in contemporary work.</p>
<p>The Glass collection has expanded considerably since the opening of the main Glass Gallery in 1994 and the Märit Rausing Gallery in 2004, with major additions of British and international glass art. The opening of a dedicated gallery for Contemporary Ceramics in 2009 has similarly provided an additional impetus for collecting, with an increased focus on international work and work of a sculptural nature.</p>
<p>Collecting has focussed on ‘fine&#8217; or artistic ceramics and glass, intended for display or domestic use, including decorated tiles. Sanitary ware, and ceramics and glass for industrial, medical, or other architectural uses are not normally acquired.</p>
<h2>THEATRE &amp; PERFORMANCE DEPARTMENT</h2>
<h3>Scope, history, standing and collecting</h3>
<p>The Theatre &amp; Performance collections are the National Collection for the Performing Arts.</p>
<p>Dedicated to the history, craft and practice of the live performing arts, with a focus on the UK, their emphasis is on drama, dance, opera, music and popular entertainment. In providing the national record of performance, they combine the functions of museum, archive, library and educational resource. Founded in 1924 by Gabrielle Enthoven, the collection constitutes one of the oldest and most significant in the world. Between 1974 and 2007 the department was referred to as the Theatre Museum. The current name was adopted when the Theatre Museum at Covent Garden closed.</p>
<p>The department documents the production and critical reception of performance by gathering a variety of evidence in different media. To this day, the Collection still follows the structure of its founder Gabrielle Enthoven (1868 – 1950), a pioneer of contemporary collecting who employed a holistic approach. Objects are collected for their significance in the history, practice and development of performance.</p>
<p>The collections fall into two main groups: Core Collections comprising the most popular and heavily used material, organised into large series according to format and material type (photographs, designs, prints, etc.), and Special Collections which are mainly archival.</p>
<p>Acquisitions are made both through pro-active gathering of documentation on a systematic basis, the pursuit of target collections and items, and the creation of the department&#8217;s own record of contemporary performance through video and photography; and through re-active consideration of material offered as a gift, purchase or bequest.</p>
<p>The department is widely regarded as leader of the many performing arts collections in the UK. It takes a central role in SIBMAS (the International Association of Performing Arts Museums and Libraries), the UK&#8217;s subject specialist network for the subject of performance &#8211; the Association of Performing Arts Collections (APAC), The Society for Theatre Research (STR), and the Theatre and Performance Research Association (TaPRA). It regularly engages in large-scale partnership projects with, and funded by, the HE sector, and other communities through HLF funding, focusing on research, digitisation, resource discovery, inspiration and creation of new works.</p>
<p>The Theatre Museum was founded as a distinct department of the V&amp;A in 1974 when the Enthoven and Beard collections were merged with the holdings of the British Theatre Museum Association and Richard Buckle&#8217;s &#8216;Friends of the Museum of Performing Arts&#8217;. The Theatre Museum&#8217;s role as the central performing arts holding was rapidly affirmed by the acquisition of the Antony Hippisley Coxe Circus Collection, and the British Puppet Guild Collection. Rock and pop was included in response to gifts from Pink Floyd, The Who, Elton John, and others, and the flourishing interest in popular music. The department is the deposit library on a <em>de facto </em>basis for professional performance in the UK and its collection of programmes is the most comprehensive in the world. No other institution documents UK performing arts from day to day or offers such depth of related material.</p>
<p>In 1987 the Theatre Museum moved from South Kensington to separate premises in Covent Garden. Over 60,000 volumes were acquired on the closure of the British Theatre Association.</p>
<p>Major archives including the Arts Council of Great Britain&#8217;s were added to the collection. Since 1992 the department has made archival recordings of selected, current productions for its National Video Archive of Performance (NVAP). Recorded performance has added a vital dimension to conventional collections by capturing performance in real time, and is heavily used for study, display and education. Our staff include a video producer and a contemporary performance curator.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the performing arts are global, collecting focuses on performance in the UK or where productions with a strong UK component have been staged around the world. It is also prioritised by subject area, strength of coverage and public demand. Where coverage is modest, a conscious decision is made either to improve the holdings, or to refer enquirers to other centres. Non-UK material may be collected where it is vital for a fuller understanding of the arts in this country. Similarly, although the collecting focus is on live performance, material relating to film, television, and radio is collected where artists, designers, writers and others have had active careers here, as well as in the theatre industry. We maintain a list of collections to be pursued which will assist the evaluation of offers of other material that the department may consider acquiring reactively. Amongst our priority areas, and with a focus on 20th and 21st-century collecting, we aim to develop the process of updating the national record of performing arts across the UK with programmes, posters, playtexts, library materials including commercial and archival recordings etc. Another area of focus is the recording of productions and interviews with key practitioners for the National Video Archive of Performance, where possible extending coverage beyond London to include other forms, especially popular entertainment. In 2016 the Department achieved the first Virtual Reality capture of a full production and continues to embrace technology in this field.</p>
<p>We continue developing pro-active photography by using the department&#8217;s photographer to record current productions and by acquiring the work of outside photographers. We selectively build holdings of modern and contemporary designs, models, costumes, prompt-books and archives, whilst aiming to develop holdings on experimental theatre in the post-1968 era, theatre for young audiences, festivals, music and archives relating to queer, Black, Asian and other ethnic minority performance.</p>
<p>The department continues to document rock and pop and its theatricality by collecting key examples of design and technology as well as photographs, archival material, etc. A further focus is the documenting of theatre architecture and stage technology through trade literature, photographs, plans, etc., to be regularly updated and relevant materials acquired and by maintaining close liaison with the Association of British Theatre Technicians, the Theatres Trust and English Heritage. We aim to develop acquisitions of library materials &#8211; new play texts and libretti professionally performed in the UK and key secondary materials including books, pamphlets, periodicals, trade catalogues, CD ROMs, commercial and archival videos, DVDs and other multimedia materials as appropriate. Collecting film which is integral or closely related to other material collected and where the conservation needs are manageable, and selectively acquiring digital material where it is fundamental to development of the subject area are further examples of our departmental targets. Finally, we wish to develop the collecting of individual records where the cover/other artwork is of design significance or collections which provide comprehensive coverage of relevant performance sectors.</p>
<h4>Drama/Theatre</h4>
<p>This area is the best represented of the performing arts in the collections. Coverage grows significantly from the 18th century onwards via playbills, programmes, posters, texts, reviews, files on practitioners, companies and theatres, books, letters, legal documents, prompt-books (e.g. for <em>Look Back in Anger </em>and <em>The Mousetrap</em>), photographic collections (e.g. Guy Little, Houston Rogers, Douglas Jeffrey, Ivan Kyncl), prints, drawings, ceramics and paintings. Costumes and accessories include examples worn by Olivier (e.g. as Richard III and Othello), Gielgud and Edith Evans, from Peter Brook&#8217;s <em>A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream</em>, and Inca masks from <em>The Royal Hunt of the Sun</em>. The design holdings, rivalled only by the Robert Tobin Collection (USA), include major work by de Loutherbourg, the Grieve family, Wilhelm, Gordon Craig, Ernst Stern, Tanya Moiseiwitsch, Maria Björnson, Leslie Hurry, Anthony Holland, Ralph Koltai, Sean Kenny, Michael Annals, Sally Jacobs, Voytek, Lez Brotherston, Mark Thompson and other leading names. The Museum is well provided with archives from theatres, companies and producers (e.g. H M Tennent, Royal Court, King&#8217;s Head, Tricycle, Almeida, Wilton&#8217;s Music Hall, Young Vic, Bernard Delfont Ltd, Unicorn and Cheek by Jowl), and actors including Paul Scofield, Ian McKellen, Vivien Leigh and Ellen Terry. Writers are well represented with the Christopher Fry personal archive covering a large span of the 20th century, alongside writers as diverse as Clemence Dane, Alfred Fagon, Tom Taylor and those produced by Paines Plough – a specialist new writing company whose archive is held by the department. Directors&#8217; collections are also held by the Department, including those of Peter Brook and Yvonne Brewster. Drama has benefited from being a priority for NVAP recording and is another rich resource for documenting the work of leading contemporary actors, directors and designers. Coverage of Black and Asian work now includes NVAP videos of productions (e.g., <em>Black Men Walking</em>, <em>Misty</em>, <em>East is East, Gem of the Ocean</em>, Lift Off, the <em>Not Black and White </em>season of Black writing at the Tricycle), interviews with leading practitioners (<em>Blackgrounds</em>), archives (Black Mime Theatre, Temba Theatre, Talawa, biographical files, photographs and other material in the core collections.</p>
<h4>Dance</h4>
<p>Dance coverage is especially strong for ballet although the focus is now on broadening dance holdings. The heart of the dance collection is the extensive Ballets Russes holdings including the world&#8217;s largest collection of costumes and scenic cloths. A particular highlight is the <em>Train Bleu</em> front cloth (after Picasso). This is supported by the Parmenia Ekstrom Collection of Diaghilev&#8217;s business papers and drawings by Valentine Gross and British artists commissioned by Cyril Beaumont. Other significant pieces include those relating to Vaslav Nijinsky and Ram Gopal. The earliest items in the collection are designs for the 17th- century <em>ballets de cour</em> and the most recent is the 21st &#8211; century Akram Khan Archive. There are extensive collections of dance costumes, designs including those by Léon Bakst, Pavel Tchelitchev, Natalia Goncharova and Howard Hodgkin, and photographic collections including Gordon Anthony, Anthony Crickmay, Chris Ha and Chris Nash. The collection is notably strong on the 19th century including Romantic Ballet Prints, Margaret Rolf&#8217;s collection on Marie Taglioni and the Georges Jacobi Collection primarily of annotated music scores for the Alhambra Ballet. Developments in 20thcentury dance are well documented with archives and collections recording London Contemporary Dance Theatre, Western Ballet, Alexander Roy&#8217;s London Ballet as well as substantial holdings on major dance companies both through the core collections and named archives.</p>
<h4>Opera and Musical Theatre</h4>
<p>Opera material includes many libretti, programmes and prints of singers and composers; an original 1720 prompt copy for Handel&#8217;s <em>Radamisto</em>; costumes worn by Chaliapin, Tito Gobbi, Boris Kristoff and Joan Sutherland and in English National Opera and Royal Opera House Covent Garden productions; models and stage cloths by John Piper for Britten premieres; and the archives of Opera Factory, and of impresario Sander Gorlinsky. A recent substantial acquisition of paintings, ceramics and archival material was made from the Gasson Collection, further strengthening coverage of opera.</p>
<p>Musical Theatre highlights include D&#8217;Oyly Carte&#8217;s Gilbert and Sullivan designs, Susan Hilferty&#8217;s Elphaba designs and costume for <em>Wicked</em>, prompt-books and photographs, the <em>Salad Days </em>magic piano, Julie Andrews&#8217;s <em>My Fair Lady </em>ball gown, the original conductor&#8217;s score for <em>Jesus Christ Superstar </em>and John</p>
<p>Napier&#8217;s model for the 1996 Lyceum revival of that show, designs for <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em> and the Bunnett-Muir Musical Theatre Archive – one of the largest musical theatre collections in the world. Much documentation on musical theatre and opera is embedded in the core collections.</p>
<h4>Other performing arts</h4>
<p><strong>Rock and Pop</strong> &#8211; includes Harry Hammond photographs of pop stars (late 1940s-60s), the photos of the Motown Review being recorded for Ready, Steady, Go! at Rediffusion&#8217;s studios in 1965, costumes worn by Mick Jagger, Adam Ant, Kiss, Shirley Bassey, Ella Fitzgerald, Tina Turner etc., Jamie Reid&#8217;s designs for The Sex Pistols, original artwork for the Rolling Stones&#8217; lips logo and Lazaridis&#8217; set model for Duran Duran&#8217;s 1993 tour.</p>
<p><strong>Circus</strong> &#8211; the UK&#8217;s best public holding. It comprises the collections of Antony Hippisley Coxe, Cyril Mills, Larry Turnbull posters and Baron de Rakoczy&#8217;s photographs of the 1920s-50s.</p>
<p><strong>Puppetry</strong> &#8211; includes rare Victorian Tiller-Clowes and Barnard marionettes, Handspring Puppet Company&#8217;s Joey made for the National Theatre production of <em>War Horse</em>, the Gair Wikinson marionettes, the British Puppet Guild Collection (mid-20th century) and extensive supporting documentation compiled by Gerald Morice. A recent acquisition is the archive of Punch &amp; Judy material collected by the respected authority on English puppet theatre, George Speaight.</p>
<p><strong>Pantomime</strong> &#8211; includes early Grimaldi prints, scripts, gag books, designs by Hugh Durrant, Wilhelm, Comelli and others, a star trap, costumes for Victorian Harlequin, pantomime dame and cow, and a large collection of pantomime scripts produced for the Howard and Wyndham circuit between the 1940s and 1970s. Contemporary pantomime costumes include examples from Hackney Empire and Danny La Rue, as well as recordings of Ian McKellen in the Old Vic&#8217;s <em>Aladdin</em> and set designs and model pieces for the London Palladium.</p>
<p><strong>Revue, Cabaret</strong> &#8211; includes C B Cochran&#8217;s scrapbooks, the archives of Chauve Souris, André Charlot, Douglas Byng, the Windmill Theatre and designs by Oliver Messel and others, costumes for Murray&#8217;s and Eve&#8217;s cabaret clubs.</p>
<p><strong>Music Hall, Variety</strong> &#8211; includes many music sheets, images and business records for the Alhambra (Alfred Moul Collection) and the circuit managed by the London Pavilion Company.</p>
<p><strong>Theatre Buildings, Technology</strong> &#8211; includes a collection of ca. 10,000 building plans by Frank Matcham &amp; Co., Colin Sorensen&#8217;s buildings files, Strand Electric&#8217;s photographs, Frederick Bentham&#8217;s (lighting control) Archive, and the Association of British Theatre Technicians&#8217; interviews with practitioners.</p>
<h4>Film</h4>
<p>Although the V&amp;A was a world museum pioneer in collecting photography from the 1850s, its attitude to collecting film in the early 20th century was not enthusiastic. Unlike early photography, considered by many to be an art form, film was seen at the time as a down market and sensational entertainment for the masses. These attitudes endured for many years and led eventually to the British Film Institute being founded in 1933. In recent years the Department&#8217;s interests have moved closer to those of the BFI, particularly on the design aspects of film. This resulted in the significant decision in 2012 for the BFI to transfer its costume collection to the V&amp;A.</p>
<h4>Comedy</h4>
<p>Since 2010, Theatre &amp; Performance has actively sought to develop its collections documenting key figures in British comedy. The department already owned the archive of the Windmill Theatre, where many key comedians such as Jimmy Edwards, Tony Hancock, Tommy Cooper and Peter Sellers began their stage careers. This has provided a rich foundation on which to build further holdings, including the Ronnie</p>
<p>Barker Collection (acquired 2011) and Malcolm Chapman&#8217;s Tony Hancock and British Comedy Collection (acquired 2012) which covers Hancock as well as many other comedians of the twentieth century, including Max Miller, Beryl Reid, Hattie Jacques, Sid James and Peter Brough. Other collections of note include the Ken Dodd Archive, the Larry Grayson Collection, Roger Lloyd Pack Archive, June Whitfield Archive, Patricia Hayes Archive and costumes worn by Dame Edna Everage, Morecambe and Wise and Hattie Jacques. The department also holds a number of scripts for radio, television and film comedy, including those for <em>Carry On</em> films, episodes of <em>Monty Python&#8217;s Flying Circus</em>, <em>Absolutely Fabulous</em>, <em>The Goon Show</em>, <em>The Vicar of Dibley</em> and <em>Benny Hill</em>.</p>
<h2>WORD AND IMAGE DEPARTMENT</h2>
<h3>Origins, scope and priorities</h3>
<p>The Word &amp; Image Department (WID) was formed when the National Art Library (NAL) (including the Archive of Art and Design) together with the Museum Archives, and the Prints, Drawings, and Paintings Department were merged in 2001. The merged Department&#8217;s collections encompass a wide range of Museum objects and literature on all the subjects covered by the Museum&#8217;s collections: more than two million items overall. This plan concentrates on the collections as exemplars of art, craft and design. There is a separate <em>Policy for the development of the NAL&#8217;s documentary materials </em>available on the V&amp;A website: (http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/n/national-art-library-collection-developmentpolicydocumentary-materials/)</p>
<p>The collections began with the Schools of Design set up at Somerset House in 1837 to help improve the teaching of design. They moved to Marlborough House in 1852 and in 1857 to the Museum at South Kensington. The title ‘National Art Library&#8217; first appeared in 1865 at a time when the <em>Universal catalogue of books on art</em> was being planned. This catalogue was an early expression of the Library&#8217;s ambition to provide a national centre for art documentation. From the outset the NAL included prints and drawings, and by 1853, photographs. In 1909 prints and drawings were transferred to a new curatorial Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design. Photographs followed much later, in 1977, when the Department&#8217;s title became Prints, Drawings &amp; Photographs. A separate Paintings Department was set up when the Museum opened at South Kensington in 1857. The Archive of Art and Design was established as part of the NAL in 1978 to assemble material already in the Museum, and to acquire archives associated with the production, marketing, promotion and study of British art and design.</p>
<p>Collecting is carried out by six sections detailed below. British work is prioritised in all areas. The collections overlap with and complement many other collections nationally and internationally but are given distinctive meaning by their context. UK partnerships include the British Museum, the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, Tate and the National Science and Media Museum with which the V&amp;A has entered into loan arrangements to maximise the value of the collections to the nation, and the National Archives which, as well as overseeing the management of public records at the V&amp;A, disseminates information on its collections via the National Register of Archives. We also work with numerous smaller bodies with complementary collections, and outreach organisations.</p>
<p>The Department has responsibility for nine collections which have ‘individual national status&#8217; (as defined by the provision of expertise and authoritative information, as well as the extent and/or significance of the collections themselves).</p>
<p>These national collections in the care of the Word and Image Department are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Architectural Drawings</li>
<li>Art of Photography</li>
<li>British Watercolours and Drawings</li>
<li>Commercial Graphics, including Posters</li>
<li>Computer Art</li>
<li>The National Art Library</li>
<li>Pastels</li>
<li>Portrait Miniatures</li>
<li>The work of John Constable (1776-1837)</li>
</ul>
<p>WID acquires historic material, especially in those areas where we have national responsibility, but in practice much of the Department&#8217;s collecting activity is now focused on the contemporary &#8211; that is, work by living artists and designers (often young or early in their careers), and with an emphasis on new media and technologies, new conceptual categories, and new object types, as well as topical material in traditional formats. The acquisition policy is essentially forward-looking, but also extends the strengths of the existing collections. The V&amp;A&#8217;s aim is to promote, support and develop the UK creative economy by inspiring artists, designers and makers, and this is reflected in our collecting.</p>
<p>Our commitment to the contemporary field necessitates a joined-up approach to identifying, assessing and taking decisions on acquisitions, given the spread of expertise on things contemporary within the Department, and also the ‘hybrid&#8217; or mixed media character of so much contemporary work.</p>
<p>This joined-up thinking extends to other Collections. We work closely with the Design, Architecture, and Digital Design section (DAD), especially in the field of architecture; and also with Asia curators who advise on and support relevant acquisitions of photography by the Word &amp; Image Department. We collaborate with the Theatre &amp; Performance Department, to coordinate our acquisition of design material, graphics and so on. The post-1900 Period Expertise Group is also a useful forum for developing a coordinated approach to collecting and for identifying those areas (such as digital art, product design, film) which the V&amp;A aims to represent coherently.</p>
<p>We collect to represent processes and techniques in all media. In terms of subject matter we seek to acquire work which reflects contemporary culture, including material which addresses political, cultural and social issues such as climate change, health and identity. By following the established patterns and purposes in collecting we are better able to collect effectively and systematically and also to co-ordinate our acquisition policy with the other national museums. At the same time, we are alert to new areas of art and design practice which may relate only tangentially to existing collection strengths, but are nevertheless pertinent to the V&amp;A&#8217;s role and remit. We aim to continue building the collections in ways which reflect the cultural diversity of London and the UK.</p>
<p>Collecting priorities are also linked to plans for new permanent galleries (and to the rotation of lightsensitive objects in such galleries) and to major exhibition projects, as well as departmental displays. It can be more cost-effective to acquire works for such projects than to borrow. Our current priorities in this area include finding works in all media for major forthcoming exhibitions. Collecting priorities can be summarised in several broad categories, but within each of those categories there are more specific priorities which may be object types, work by individual named artists, or work from particular groups or geographic areas. Priorities for each curatorial section are given below.</p>
<h4>The Archive of Art and Design (AAD)</h4>
<p>The collection of some 350 archives aims to represent the design process from conception to consumption and provides a preeminent point of access to primary source material for the study of applied art and design. It includes records of individual artists and designers, businesses and institutions involved in the production, marketing, promotion and study of art and design, including order books, correspondence, accounts, diaries, photographs, and promotional material. Architects&#8217; archives are, where appropriate, directed to the RIBA and fine arts archives to Tate; in other areas the V&amp;A is as anxious to ensure that archives find an appropriate home as to add them to the V&amp;A&#8217;s collection.</p>
<p>Priorities for the AAD are shaped by two factors, the first being a moral obligation to accept accruals to our existing archival collections to prevent archives being dispersed unnecessarily, and the second being limited storage space. Our practice is to consider high-quality material only, by which we mean that it is from a significant name; or that it documents a career or business concisely; material which represents the design process clearly; or where there will be strong research interest. Our other priorities are archives which fill a gap in our holdings (examples include ceramics design, or male fashion), or which supplement our strongest existing holdings (e.g. stained glass, silver). Archives with strong links to a particular locality are directed to a local authority repository; we always seek a suitable alternative home for an archive before we decide to acquire it for the V&amp;A.</p>
<h4>Designs</h4>
<p>The designs collection of over 80,000 drawing is stored and made accessible by WID with the curator matrix-managed between DADD and WID. The collection has some international rivals for major historical material, but no national rivals except in terms of architectural drawings, where the holdings complement those of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). The British Museum has occasionally acquired design drawings, as works of art, rather than as examples of a design process.</p>
<p>The V&amp;A has a remit to lead public perception and understanding of design as a category and as a process, and this must be reflected in our collecting policy. In the field of design drawings, we continue to collect contemporary examples in those areas in which we already have strong holdings and which relate directly to the other V&amp;A collections – furniture, textiles, ceramics, and metalwork. We also collect drawings for architecture, sculpture, the applied and industrial arts, product design, fashion. Areas of design activity which fall outside these traditional categories are now being targeted: product design, fashion design and illustration, garden design, designs relating to shops and shopping, and graphic design (complementing existing strengths in the print collections).</p>
<p>Though much of the design material we collect relates to the domestic milieu, we also aim to collect designs for public projects, such as monuments and sculpture. Wherever possible we aim to acquire the complete ‘job bag&#8217; (everything from first concept to specification). We want to reflect the importance of Computer Aided Design in the design industry. 3D models are collected where they play a significant part in demonstrating or elucidating the design process.</p>
<p>A cross-Museum approach is being taken to collecting architecture, led by DAD. Architects&#8217; drawings are collected with a focus on global architecture; the RIBA collects the work of British architects only. The V&amp;A&#8217;s purpose in collecting is to represent the art of architecture, architecture in relation to the other design disciplines, and the connection between architectural design and society; the RIBA collects material in order to represent the processes of architecture. Since 2004 the RIBA collection has been housed at the V&amp;A. The RIBA collection is very large (ca. 1,000,000 items) and is the property of its membership. WID&#8217;s collection differs from the RIBA in that it includes designs for building by type, as well as by architect.</p>
<p>We do not proactively acquire design for film, which is the province primarily of the British Film Institute. However, where a designer&#8217;s career includes film among other design disciplines, or where specific works clearly relate to existing strands of V&amp;A collecting and offer new perspectives on other design disciplines such as architecture, interiors, furniture, graphics and fashion, design for film is considered for the V&amp;A&#8217;s collection.</p>
<h4>Paintings</h4>
<p>The collection contains over 2000 oil paintings, of which around one third are Continental and two thirds are British; over 2000 portrait miniatures; over 7000 watercolours; over 10,000 British drawings, illustrations and sketchbooks; and over 4000 continental drawings including Old Masters, watercolours, illustrations and sketchbooks.</p>
<p>The collection began in 1843 with the purchase of copies of decoration by Raphael. It expanded in 1857 with John Sheepshanks&#8217; gift of 233 oil paintings and 289 watercolours, drawings and etchings by mainly contemporary British artists, which was known for 50 years as the National Gallery of British Art. Since the foundation of Tate in 1897, most collecting of oils has been of decorative paintings, works related to decorative schemes, representations of design and the decorative arts (including buildings and landscape gardens), and portraits of practitioners of art and design. The collection of 19<sup>th</sup>century British oil paintings, which includes the principal collection of John Constable, is, nonetheless, second only to that of Tate. The foreign oil paintings are also of national significance.</p>
<p>We continue to have national responsibility for collecting British watercolours and also British portrait miniatures, an unrivalled collection, with foreign examples acquired to provide a wider context. In addition, it is agreed with the British Museum, the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery and Tate that we should have national responsibility for pastels. We also collect drawings and have strength in Italian, Netherlandish and French as well as British examples, and such amateur media as silhouettes and cut-paper work. The collection is outstanding for the range of painting media represented, from late antiquity to the present.</p>
<p>In collecting unique works on paper, we continue the established pattern of acquisition, concentrating on the work of British artists, and artists working in Britain, including recent immigrants and artists from the African and Asian diaspora. We continue to focus on the innovative use of traditional media, and on the processes and techniques of artistic production. Drawings by sculptors and installation artists are particularly desirable. With three recognised ‘national&#8217; collections (portrait miniatures; British watercolours; pastels) we continue to give priority to significant acquisitions in these areas.</p>
<h4>Photographs</h4>
<p>The V&amp;A holds one of the world&#8217;s largest and most important collections of photography. The collection is international and spans the whole history of the subject from before it was officially announced to the public in 1839 to the present. It numbers about 800,000 photographs and is designated the National Collection of the Art of Photography. The collection is extremely broad, covering the cultures of photography from its use as a fine art to science, photojournalism, fashion, and many other applications.</p>
<p>The V&amp;A was the first museum in the UK to collect photographs, beginning in 1852, and the first to hold a photography exhibition, in 1858. Throughout the 19<sup>th</sup> century, as well as building an extensive &#8216;virtual museum&#8217; of reproductive photographs illustrating art, architecture and design, acquisitions were also made directly from major creative photographers and photography was recognized by the museum as a creative art in its own right. In 1977, much of the photographic collection transferred from the NAL to the re-named Prints, Drawings, Paintings &amp; Photographs Department. Holdings of 19<sup>th &#8211; </sup>and more especially 20<sup>th </sup>&#8211; century classic photographs have since expanded rapidly, and the collection of contemporary photographs has become a priority.</p>
<p>In 2017, the Royal Photographic Society (RPS) Collection was transferred to the V&amp;A from the Science Museum Group. It comprises approximately 270,000 photographs, 6,000 cameras and pieces of related equipment, and 26,000 volumes of photographic books and periodicals, as well as an archive of important letters. The arrival of this major collection was the impetus for creating the Photography Centre, Phase 1 of which opened in October 2018, more than doubling the space dedicated to photography. Phase 2 will double the space again, to a total of approximately 1030 square metres (11,000 square feet), and is scheduled for completion in 2022. Although cameras and related equipment from the RPS Collection are exhibited in the Photography Centre, we do not continue to collect such material. The Centre includes a Project Space for newly commissioned work and a Light Wall of screens for displaying born-digital photography. Our policies for commissioning and collecting born-digital or screen-based photography are being developed with DADD.</p>
<p>The history of photography has traditionally been centred on Western Europe and the United States, and we will always seek to improve our holdings of such classic photographs. In the past decade we have prioritised collecting work from the Middle East, Africa and African diaspora, Eastern Europe, and Asia. We remain keen to diversify our holdings to reflect a broad range of important cultural and political issues. We continue to focus on work by emerging photographers, especially those trained or working in Britain. Other priorities include contemporary fashion photography, photojournalism, vintage mid-20<sup>th</sup> century photographs and items that exemplify a range of processes and techniques. Photo books and books made by artists using photography continue to be an area of interest, and these are collected by the National Art Library in consultation with Photographs curators.</p>
<p>A Photographs Acquisition Group (PAG) was established in 2011 to help the Museum expand and diversify its renowned collection, and keep it up to date. PAG brings enthusiasts and collectors with a shared passion for photography into closer dialogue with the Museum&#8217;s curators. Donations from the group help the Museum plan for and continue to broaden its holdings, purchase historic and contemporary work, support emerging photographers and commission new work from contemporary practitioners. We are also founding members of the UK Photographic Collections Network (PCN), a Subject Specialist Network supported by the Arts Council and Art Fund. The PCN devises and hosts training and networking events for members, provides advice for institutions, collectors and practitioners taking care of photographic collections. It aspires in future to establish an online catalogue of UK public photography collections.</p>
<p>Overall, the focus of the section&#8217;s collecting is to facilitate changing displays, research and publications and to connect with other areas of the V&amp;A&#8217;s collections. The Collecting Strategy is designed to tell a balanced chronological history of photography in the Museum&#8217;s annual changing displays, to contribute photographs to the Museum&#8217;s periods and styles galleries and to contribute to the headline temporary exhibition programme.</p>
<h4>Prints</h4>
<p>This section is responsible for collecting printed images created as works of art or to fulfil a practical purpose. The Print collection had its origins in the teaching collections of the Government School of Design. From 1909 prints were part of Engraving, Illustration and Design and its successor departments.</p>
<p>The Prints collection comprises ca. 500,000 items, including fine art prints from the Renaissance to the present; printed designs for the decorative arts; portraits; topography; social history subjects, religious and pagan symbolism; costume and fashion plates; fan leaves; caricatures; playing cards, packaging, stationery, posters and other commercial graphics; wallpapers; and reproductive prints.</p>
<p>Uniquely in Britain, the Prints collection embraces &#8216;fine&#8217; prints and commercial production. It also houses the most comprehensive collection of printed designs for the decorative arts in the UK, one of the world&#8217;s foremost collections, and is the only museum collection that aims to represent the history of how prints have been presented and displayed. It does not seek to rival the British Museum&#8217;s collection of Old Master prints, although acquisitions in this field are made to improve representation of printmaking techniques, where we aim to be comprehensive, and where specific works are needed for gallery projects and touring exhibitions. The V&amp;A is the only national institution to have consistently collected prints by living artists since the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>The V&amp;A is the only UK museum to collect across the whole spectrum of ‘print&#8217; from ephemera to fine art. Many of our priority areas for collecting extend or build on established strengths (wallpapers, greetings cards, fine art prints) but focus on manifestations which employ new media or have new applications. For example, it is a continuing priority to acquire wallpapers designed by artists and made specifically for installations and exhibitions; our greetings card acquisitions now include examples for the holidays and festivals of various cultures, and cards promoting companies and institutions. The V&amp;A does not collect postcards. In the field of fine-art prints, we are especially interested in examples which employ digital or other new or unconventional media, and the application of print to 3D formats, including unique works as well as multiples. Within fine art printmaking, other key priorities include work by artists from Africa and the African diaspora, and from Russia and Latin America.</p>
<p>Of our traditional collecting strengths, posters (commercial and political) remain a high priority.</p>
<p>Significant gaps in our holdings include work from the Polish Poster School (1950s – 1980s) as our current holdings are not representative of this important area; International Typographic School (largely Swiss in origin); ‘new wave&#8217; graphic design of the 1980s; Chicano posters, which are largely missing from our otherwise good holdings of 1960s and 70s agit-prop posters. We also wish to acquire more material relating to the design process for posters, since our current holdings of original poster artwork mainly relate to pre-war London Transport posters. As with the other sections (Designs, Digital Art) we also want to find ways to ‘collect&#8217; or archive posters and other graphics which exist only in a digital form. Strategies for collecting contemporary material include visiting international poster biennales, working with the Design and Art Direction awards to get copies of the best of the nominated posters, and liaising with commissioning organizations such as Transport for London&#8217;s Art on the Underground. We are alert to current events which generate posters, such as the Olympic Games, and UK and US elections, as well as activism and protest world-wide.</p>
<p>In keeping with the Museum&#8217;s founding emphasis on design and making, we are keen to acquire material relating to the processes of printmaking, such as blocks, plates and proofs (with published impressions, if we do not already hold them), subject to the usual criteria with regard to the quality of the work. We also continue to collect printed designs for the decorative arts; likewise, trade cards relating to products in the V&amp;A collections – particularly textiles and dress, furniture and interiors, metalwork, jewellery, ceramics and glass, as well as the printing trade.</p>
<h4>The Art and Design of the Book</h4>
<p>The National Art Library collects examples of the arts and design of text and image, and the formats in which ideas and illustrations are published, ranging from medieval manuscripts to modern paperbacks.</p>
<p>Its national status relates to the scale and specialism of the library as a whole, but several individual aspects of the collection are of national significance: medieval, Renaissance and modern illuminated manuscripts, modern calligraphy (representative for the post Edward Johnston revival period, British and foreign), book bindings, artists&#8217; books, comics and graphic novels. The Renier Collection of 80,000 children&#8217;s book is the largest in the country (new acquisitions of children&#8217;s books are infrequent). The NAL does not in general collect original artwork and designs, but alongside the AAD it holds the largest collection anywhere of Beatrix Potter&#8217;s art, manuscripts and related material, and occasionally makes additions. Collecting is done with reference to major national collections such as the British Library, Tate and other specialist organizations. As for WID at large, the main emphasis is on current production rather than antiquarian items.</p>
<p>Western medieval and post-medieval illuminated manuscripts were acquired from the 1850s onwards, as complete volumes but also as cuttings (over 2,000 pieces). Although the primary reason for their acquisition was so that they could serve as a design source for artists and craftsmen, some were collected for their outstanding quality or as fine examples of the work of celebrated illuminators. The NAL is noteworthy for documenting the persistence of illumination into the modern era and its manifestations in print, and seeks opportunities to continue strengthening this area. Examples of early printing were collected in a similar way, in the form of complete works as well as single pages or cuttings. This aimed to provide an encyclopedic account of book design and ornament. The cuttings are now for the most part held in PDP collections while complete volumes are in the NAL. The collection of fine bindings similarly aims to provide an overview from the middle ages to the present, with an emphasis on European examples: this we aspire to enhance through commissions if possible. The Clements Collection is outstanding for historical armorial bindings from the British Isles. Holdings of illustrated books in trade and deluxe bindings are also extensive. The collection is strong in publications of selected private presses, writing and lettering books, fine typography, and <em>livres d&#8217;artistes</em>. With the traditional crafts and technologies of the book thus well represented, additional examples are acquired today only if they are particularly relevant to the collection or to contemporary conditions of book production.</p>
<p>The 20th-century Book Art collection was built up during the 1980s and 1990s to become the foremost in Britain. In this period book art became established as an art practice in its own right. Today artists&#8217; books of all kinds are acquired, albeit very selectively. We collect to represent the response and impact of significant artists when they address the concepts and formats of the book. We also continue to document the ongoing development of book art as an art practice, especially work responding to changes in the contemporary scenes of publishing and the distribution of ideas. Since 2014 the predominant focus of collecting has been on photo books, primarily those published by small independent presses or by artists themselves, in a vibrant culture specific to the very recent past and present. Digital works were first acquired in the 1990s, in physical formats now becoming obsolete; in future we may address digital artists&#8217; publications in liaison with DADD, if a sustainable infrastructure for storage and access is established. Acquisitions are naturally linked where possible to museum programmes or existing holdings in the NAL and in other departments. With the bulk of British artists&#8217; books collected at the British Library through active curation as well as legal deposit, we focus more on Europe and the U.S., aiming to complement rather than duplicate other collections.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, the National Art Library has built up its comics holdings very substantially, on the basis of several large private collections. The main strength is American, including separate collections of Romance and Disney -based comics; balanced by a collection of amateur British ‘mini-comics&#8217;. In collecting comics, the aim is to provide a study collection representative of all formats, of major centres of production, and of innovative design and art-work. Individual items are added if they are newsworthy, or if they evoke an important aspect of contemporary life or are inspired by artistic and design subjects.</p>
<p>Museum collections have represented commercial design from the outset. The Jobbing Printing collection of commercial graphics, 1936, is a noteworthy example, but The Library collected examples of modern book design from the 1860s. Innovative commercial book production of the 20<sup>th</sup> century in the form of paperbacks, dust jackets, and children&#8217;s books was also added to the collection. A small collection of annually ‘trawled&#8217; items documents ‘High Street&#8217; book and magazine design in the early 21<sup>st</sup> century. Today, examples are collected only very selectively, on grounds of excellence or influence, and ‘the everyday book as a designed object&#8217; is currently beyond the NAL&#8217;s collecting scope, not least because of space constraints. Acknowledging this, the British Library loan deposit of 500,000 20<sup> th</sup> -century dust jackets was returned to the BL in 2016. In 2016 the Library welcomed the Jacqueline and Jonathan Gestetner Collection, the world&#8217;s largest and most comprehensive collection of paper peepshows, allocated through the Cultural Gifts Scheme. Primarily dating from the 19th century, earlier and later examples are included.</p>
<p>The name ‘Word and Image&#8217; leads to expectations of an illustration specialism. The NAL has extensive holdings of illustrated books, on such subjects as natural history and botany, topography, costume and all the decorative arts, as well as literary and imaginative works. These reflect both the needs of early student designers and artists for visual information about the world, and the fact that illustration provided a career for artists, especially once 19th-century technological and educational developments created a large market for illustrated magazines. After 1909 the Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design actively pursued illustration of all kinds in original artwork and separate prints. Related books often were held in the Library, and illustrated bookplates and dust jackets were collected by both departments. The Archive of Art &amp; Design has acquired a number of illustrators&#8217; archives. Thus, research material relevant to illustration is distributed broadly across the Word &amp; Image Department. In 2018, the remit of the Frederick Warne Curator was reconceived to focus on illustration, and coordinate acquisitions of illustration artwork where appropriate. The contemporary illustration industry is supported primarily through the annual V&amp;A Illustration Awards rather than collecting. Museological and art-historical illustration, both graphic and photographic, are of course copiously represented in the Library&#8217;s extensive documentary holdings.</p>
<h4>Digital Art</h4>
<p>Until the early 2000s, the Museum held relatively few works that illustrate the early years of computergenerated art and design. However, the Department now holds one of the world&#8217;s largest collections of computer art, created from the late 1950s onwards. For the purposes of this plan, the term ‘computer art&#8217; is used for works created before the advent of personal computers, or in a similar style if created later.</p>
<p>Various other terms are used to describe specific categories or genres, but we use the broader term Digital Art to characterise the collection as a whole. In practice, computer-aided design and computer graphics were closely related to computer art in the early years of the new medium. Prints of computergenerated images began to enter the Department&#8217;s collection as early as 1969, soon after the groundbreaking <em>Cybernetic Serendipity</em> exhibition held at London&#8217;s Institute of Contemporary Arts. A few other computer-generated works were acquired from time to time, but the strength of the collection today is the result of two major acquisitions: the Patric Prince Collection and the archives of the Computer Arts Society. The V&amp;A now holds an internationally significant collection of computer art from the 1960s to the 1990s and beyond. Together, these major acquisitions form the basis for the V&amp;A&#8217;s national collection of computer-generated art.</p>
<p>The bulk of the artworks in the Patric Prince Collection and Computer Arts Society Collection consist of plotter drawings, screen prints, inkjet prints, posters and photographs, but there are also examples in other media, including 3D images and computer files. Patric Prince was an art historian and archivist of computer art. Based in California, she actively collected computer-assisted art works for many years. In addition to some 200 individual artworks, the collection also contains books, archival material and ephemera, including monographs, manuals, exhibition catalogues, slides, off-prints and interviews with practising artists. Because the early history of digital culture is still under-documented, the material she accumulated is now of great significance to researchers.</p>
<p>The Museum also holds the archives of the Computer Arts Society (CAS), including some 200 artworks. As computer artists passed through London, they often gave the Society examples of their work. These were stored until the V&amp;A acquired the collection in 2007, along with the Society&#8217;s working records of its own activities. The CAS material complements the Patric Prince collection perfectly. So-called ‘algorithmic&#8217; works are particularly well represented, and the Department now holds significant pieces by major figures such as A. Michael Noll, Georg Nees, Frieder Nake, Vera Molnar, Manfred Mohr, Harold Cohen, Paul Brown, Roman Verostko, Jean-Pierre Hebert and Mark Wilson. We continue to build on these core collections, and have also acquired additional computer-generated works on paper by artists such as Frederick Hammersley, Darrell Viner, and Colette and Jeff Bangert. We also seek to expand our holdings in some under-represented areas, such as South American computer art.</p>
<p>We also collect recent born-digital artworks selectively, by artists such as Daniel Brown, Aaron Koblin, Casey Reas and Andy Lomas. The technological and logistical problems of preservation and display lead us to focus on works that require little or no active maintenance. Where necessary, we do also acquire digital artworks that depend on specific hardware or software, but we remain conscious of the long-term consequences of doing this. Priority is given to digital works, or applications of digital technology, which complement or extend our holdings in other media (e.g. computer art on paper, the book, wallpaper, etc.). The V&amp;A&#8217;s Design, Architecture and Digital Design Department Is now responsible for contemporary collecting in areas that relate to designed objects, such as information design, videogames and the use of digital technologies in product design, architecture and other disciplines.</p>

				     	<p>The Wiltshire Museum is run by the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society (WANHS), an independent charity founded in Devizes in 1853. The Society was founded by a group of Wiltshire gentlemen following the acquisition of the John Britton library of topographical and antiquarian books and manuscripts. The inaugural meeting resolved to form a society &#8216;to cultivate and collect information on archaeology and natural history in their various branches and to form a library and museum illustrating the history, natural, civic and ecclesiastic of the County of Wilts&#8217;.</p>
<p>The Society held exhibitions in various buildings in the town, before moving to the former Grammar School in 1873 and building a new entrance hall before opening in 1874. It acquired adjoining Georgian town houses in 1903 and 1943, and opened a new art gallery extension in 1980.</p>
<p>Over the last 167 years, the Society has built a membership of over 1,000 members and its collections are Designated by Government as being of national significance. The most important is the Stourhead Collection, namely the objects and archives of the excavations undertaken by William Cunnington over 200 years ago, mostly in the Stonehenge and Avebury World Heritage Site.</p>

				     	<h2>Archaeology Collection (before 1600 AD)</h2>
<p>The archaeology collection is the most important part of all the collections. It is extensive, numbering an estimated 45,000 items (bulk finds from archaeological assemblages counted as one item), and wide ranging in its scope, covering all periods of human history in Wiltshire. The great strength of the collection lies in its prehistoric material, in particular that of Neolithic to Iron Age date.</p>
<p>The archaeology collection includes the finds from over 650 excavations in Wiltshire, the most significant of which are from the hundred or so early Bronze Age barrows excavated in the early 19th century by Sir Richard Colt Hoare and William Cunnington I. This collection is known as the Stourhead Collection.</p>
<p>The early Bronze Age collection is of exceptional importance because of its size and range; the uniqueness of many of the objects; the fact that it includes many prestige items, including objects made of gold, amber, jet and shale; its association with the Stonehenge and Avebury World Heritage Site, and its relevance to the history of archaeology. A selection of the collection was most recently published in, Ritual in Early Bronze Age Grave Goods: An examination of ritual and dress equipment from Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age graves in England. J Hunter and A Woodward, 2015.</p>
<p>The objects from archaeological excavations are complemented by casual finds, again of all periods, including items declared as ‘treasure’ under the Treasure Act (1996).</p>
<h2>Recent History Collection (post 1600 AD)</h2>
<p>The recent history collection numbers around 9,000 items and focuses on life in the district formerly known as Kennet, since 1600. Kennet was a non-metropolitan local government district in Wiltshire, which was abolished as part of structural changes to local government in 2009. For the purposes of this document the term ‘Kennet District’ continues to refer to this geographical area. As ‘districts’ have only existed as political areas since 1974, inevitably the museum holds items acquired in the more distant past from elsewhere in Wiltshire. It also holds some classes of object which relate to all of Wiltshire.</p>
<p>The main subject areas are local trades and industries, domestic items, education, law and order, agriculture, personalia and sport. The collection includes a number of individual items of particular significance. The strength of the collection lies in the objects relating to the history of Devizes (which links to the Devizes collection in the archive and library) and Avebury parish.</p>
<p>A more recent addition to the recent history collection is the Wiltshire Life Society Collection, transferred to the Collections Trust from the Lackham Museum of Agriculture and Rural Life Trust in 2010. The collection was previously on display in the Great Barn at Avebury until 2000. The collection includes 650 agricultural items and a library of 400 related books and 400 photographs. The collection was transferred with funding for its long-term care.</p>
<h2>Numismatics Collection</h2>
<p>The collection numbers around 28,000 coins, medallions, tokens, banknotes and related items. It consists chiefly of coins found in Wiltshire and coins etc which were either struck in Wiltshire or which refer to Wiltshire people, places or events. There is also a small general collection of Roman and English coins. The first group includes coin hoards deposited between the Iron Age and Civil War period, and assemblages of coins from the excavations of archaeological sites and stray finds of coins. The second group includes Saxon and Norman coins struck at Wiltshire mints; tokens of different types issued in Wiltshire from the 17th century; banknotes etc. issued by local banks and medallions relating to the county. There are a number of unique items. The strength of the collection lies in the comparatively large number of Iron Age coins, the scope of its collection of Wiltshire tokens, medallions and banknotes and, in provincial terms, the size of its Roman coin collection.</p>
<h2>Natural Sciences Collection</h2>
<p>The natural sciences collection was mainly donated by individual botanists and geologists, although Salisbury, Swindon and Trowbridge museums hold small collections of locally found fossils. The collection numbers around 25,000 specimens from the whole of Wiltshire. The Geology collection contains over 6,000 fossils with representative specimens from every rock type in the county. Of particular importance are the Greensand and Chalk fossils donated by William Cunnington III, most of whose collection was given to the Natural History Museum, London, in 1906.</p>
<p>On the botanical side the museum houses a Society Flora started by T B Flower and T A Preston in 1870 which now contains around 3,000 specimens, collected up to 1966. The ‘Grose Herbarium’ consists of 9,000 sheets of fully documented pressed plant specimens collected by Donald Grose while he was writing The Flora of Wiltshire. Another important holding is the collection of lichens and bryophytes assembled by Francis Rose.</p>
<p>Animal bones, plant remains etc. from archaeological excavations in Wiltshire are considered in the Archaeology and Recent History Collections above.</p>
<h2>Art Collection</h2>
<p>The art collection comprises original watercolours, drawings, oil paintings, prints and engravings, amounting to approximately 10,000 works in total. The collection consists primarily of works by Wiltshire artists, who were either born in or have other associations with Wiltshire; and works depicting Wiltshire subjects. There are a small number of paintings which are associated with significant people from Wiltshire. The art collection covers the work of most of the topographical artists who have worked in the west of England since 1750. It also has close links with the archaeological collection, with for example numerous views of Stonehenge and Avebury and other archaeological monuments and paintings by archaeologists and historians such as Sir Richard Colt Hoare, John Britton and Denis Grant King. A selection of the collection was published in Richard Hatchwell&#8217;s <em>Art in Wiltshire</em> (2005); the Public Catalogue Foundation’s volume of <em>Oil Paintings in Public Ownership: Gloucestershire &amp; Wiltshire</em> (2011); <em>The Watercolour World</em> – showcasing online 1,400 watercolour pictures from the art collection (2019).</p>
<p>The strength of the collection lies in its topographical collection which includes nearly 600 watercolours of Wiltshire churches and other buildings by John Buckler from almost every Wiltshire parish, as well as its collection of works relating to archaeology, including the watercolour drawings of archaeological objects made by Philip Crocker which served as the originals for engravings in Sir Richard Colt Hoare&#8217;s Ancient Wiltshire.</p>
<h2>Archive and Library Collections</h2>
<p>The archive and library collection is one of the largest and last surviving independent county repositories in the UK, numbering approximately 37,000 items (bulk accessioned where appropriate). The collection originates from the acquisition of the John Britton library of topographical and antiquarian books and manuscripts and the subsequent founding of the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society in 1853. Appropriate archival documents were transferred to the Wiltshire Record Office after it was created, over 100 years later and are now held at the Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre.</p>
<p>It is primarily a local studies collection of books, journals, newspapers and other printed items including photographs, postcards and maps relating to Wiltshire. There is also a document collection consisting of both printed material and original manuscripts.</p>
<p>The collection has a separate archaeology section which includes a general collection of archaeology books, the principal archaeology journals, papers of Wiltshire antiquaries and the written records of more recent excavations in the county. The natural history section similarly includes general natural history books, specialist journals and the papers of early natural historians. These complement the museum collections. There is also a smaller general history collection. As well as reference books on art history and decorative art there are a number of individual unique items in the library.</p>
<p>Particularly important areas of the collection include the papers and annotated books by early antiquaries and historians such as William Stukeley, Sir Richard Colt Hoare and William Cunnington 1, as well as the collection of printed ephemera and the extensive range of national and county journals.</p>

    <h3>Collection-level records</h3>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>Some Accredited museums (or multi-site services covering a number of museums) have shared with MDS a brief history of the collections in their care. These collection histories mostly come from the museums’ collection development policies, though they are no longer a mandatory section of the policies required by the Museum Accreditation Scheme.</p>
<h4>Collection Overview</h4>
<p>Accredited museums (or multi-site services covering a number of museums) are required to have a collection development policy that includes a brief overview of the scope and strengths of the collections in their care. Collection overviews are an incredibly useful starting point for anyone who wants to navigate the nation’s museum holdings, and we are very grateful to all those museums that have shared their overviews with MDS. In some cases, we have included overviews from a legacy dataset called ‘Cornucopia’.</p>

    <h3>Object records in MDS</h3>
<p class="p1">This figure is the number of datasets currently in MDS, rather than the number of museums. This is because some datasets come from multi-site services. For example, Norfolk Museum Service has contributed a single dataset, but this includes records about items held in the service’s eleven branch museums. On our <a href="https://museumdata.uk/object-search/"><span class="s1">Object search landing page</span></a>, you can see the number of Accredited museums represented in these datasets.</p>

    <h3>Museum/collection status</h3>
<h4>Accredited Museum</h4>
<p>These museums meet the nationally-agreed standards of the <a href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/supporting-arts-museums-and-libraries/uk-museum-accreditation-scheme">UK Museum Accreditation Scheme</a> run by Arts Council England, Museums Galleries Scotland, NI Museums Council and the Welsh Government. In the case of multi-site services, the individual branch museums are Accredited, but the overarching service is usually not. Eg Yorkshire Museums Trust is responsible for three Accredited museums, but is not itself Accredited.</p>
<h4>Designated Collection</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/designated-collections">Designation Scheme</a>, run by Arts Council England, recognises cultural collections of outstanding importance held in non-national museums, libraries and archives across England. There are over 160 Designated collections, but only the museum ones are included in our database here.</p>
<h4>Recognised Collection</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.museumsgalleriesscotland.org.uk/recognition/recognised-collections/">Museums Galleries Scotland Recognition Scheme</a> includes more than fifty Recognised Collections of National Significance, some spread across more than one museum. Here we count the number of museums containing parts of those collections, which is why the figure displayed here is higher than that quoted on the MGS website. There is currently no equivalent scheme for Wales or Northern Ireland.</p>
